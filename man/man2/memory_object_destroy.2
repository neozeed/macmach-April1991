.SH DESCRIPTION

.B memory_object_destroy
tells the kernel to shut down the memory object.
As a result of this call the kernel will no longer support paging activity
or any memory_object calls on this object, and all rights 
to the memory object port, the memory control
port and the memory name port will be returned to the memory manager in a
.B memory_object_terminate
call. If the memory manager is concerned that
any modified cached data be returned to it before the object is terminated,
it should call 
.B memory_object_lock_request
with 
.B should_flush
set
and a lock value of 
.B VM_PROT_WRITE
before making this call.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 15
.B
memory_control
The port, provided by the kernel 
in a 
.B memory_object_init
call, to which cache management requests may be issued.
.TP 15
.B
reason
An error code indicating when the object must be destroyed.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 25
KERN_SUCCESS
This routine does not receive a reply message (and consequently
has no return value), so only message transmission errors apply.

.SH SEE ALSO
.B memory_object_terminate, memory_object_lock_request

.SH BUGS

The error code is currently ingnored.
