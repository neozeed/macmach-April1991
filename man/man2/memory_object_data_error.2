.SH DESCRIPTION

.B memory_object_data_error
indicates that the memory manager cannot return
the data requested for the given region, specifying a reason for the error.
This is typically used when a hardware error is encountered.

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 15
.B
memory_control
The port, provided by the kernel 
in a 
.B memory_object_init
call, to which cache management requests may be issued.
.TP 15
.B
offset
An offset within a memory object, in bytes.  This must be
page aligned.
.TP 15
.B
size
The amount of cached data (starting at 
.B offset
) to be handled.
This must be an integral multiple of the memory object page size.
.TP 15
.B
reason
Could be a Unix error code for a hardware error.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 25
KERN_SUCCESS
This routine does not receive a reply message (and consequently
has no return value), so only message transmission errors apply.

.SH SEE ALSO
.B memory_object_data_request, memory_object_data_provided

.SH BUGS

The error code is currently ignored.
