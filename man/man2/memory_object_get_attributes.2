.SH DESCRIPTION

.B memory_object_get_attributes
retrieves the current attributes
associated with the memory object.  

.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 15
.B
memory_control
The port, provided by the kernel 
in a 
.B memory_object_init
call, to which cache management requests may be issued.
.TP 15
.B
object_ready
When set, the kernel may issue new data and unlock requests on the
associated memory object.
.TP 15
.B
may_cache_object
If set, the kernel may keep data 
associated with this
memory object, even after virtual memory references to it are gone.
.TP 15
.B
copy_strategy
How the kernel should copy regions of the associated
memory object.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 25
KERN_SUCCESS
This routine does not receive a reply message (and consequently
has no return value), so only message transmission errors apply.
