.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP 15
.B
thread
The thread to be assigned.
.TP 15
.B
processor_set
The processor set to assign it to.

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B thread_assign
assigns 
.B thread
the the set 
.B processor_set.
After the assignment is completed, the thread only executes on processors
assigned to the designated processor set.  If there are no such processors,
then the thread is unable to execute.  Any previous assignment of
the thread is nullified.  Unix system call compatibility code may
temporarily force threads to execute on the master processor.

.B thread_assign_default
is a variant of 
.B thread_assign
that assigns the thread to the default processor set.  This variant exists
because the control port for the default processor set is privileged and
therefore not available to most users.

.B thread_get_assignment
returns the name of the processor set to which the thread is currently
assigned.  This port can only be used to obtain information about the
processor set.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
.TP 25
KERN_SUCCESS
The assignment has been performed.
.TP 25
KERN_INVALID_ARGUMENT
.B thread
is not a thread, or 
.B processor_set
is not a processor_set on the same host as 
.B thread.
.TP 25
KERN_INVALID_ADDRESS
.B processor_set
points to inaccessible memory (thread_get_assignment only).

.SH BUGS
Availability limited.
