This directory contains the Bison parser generator.

On systems that do not have a working `alloca' function, you will
have to get a working `alloca' (perhaps from GNU Emacs) and edit the
Makefile so that it will be used.  On system V, specifying -lPW
when you link may accomplish this.

On system V, you will need to define the macro USG while compiling.

It was once true that, when installing Bison on Sequent (or Pyramid?)
systems, you had to be in the Berkeley universe.  This may no longer
be true; we have no way to tell.

On VMS, remember to do `SET COMMAND BISON' to install the data in 
`BISON.CLD'.

Send bug reports to bug-gnu-utils@prep.ai.mit.edu.  Please include the
version number from version.c, and a complete, self-contained test
case in each bug report.
