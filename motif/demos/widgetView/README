widgetView - Motif examination program for exploring widgets.


widgetView
----------

WidgetView provides a mechanism for you to interactively manipulate Motif
widgets.  Selecting a widget will recall all resources from the widget and
display the widget.  You then may change the values of the resources and
apply the changes.

BUGS:

	1. Between X11R3 and X11R4, the data types Dimension and Position were
	   changed from an unsigned integer to an unsigned short, and from an
	   integer to a short, respectively.  We did not have time before the
	   release of Motif 1.1 to modify widgetView to reflect these changes.
	   As a result, this demo will not run on architectures which utilize
	   different byte ordering than the DEC PMAX reference platform (the
	   PMAX is a "little-endian" machine, so widgetView will fail on all
	   "big-endian" machines).


If you stress widgetView, it will break.  Don't depend on it.

Many of the functions do work, however, and the tool provides an excellent
training environment for learning Motif.

If you notice any other bugs in this demo, please see the bug list in
the Release Notes to see if the problem is a known Toolkit defect.
