This directory contains font files for japanese (Kanji and Katakana) and
Hebrew (ISO8859-8) character sets. They are provided for the japanese
and hebrew demos of hellohebrew, hellokanji, periodickanji and 
motifburgerint. 

To build the fonts for a DEC system execute mkfont.DEC; for HP excute 
mkfont.HP. 

To add this directory to the font list use the xset command below:

	xset +fp dir

where dir is the full directory specification of this dictory. Then type

	xset fp rehash 

to rescan the the font directories. 

Or use xset to set a new font path:

	xset fp /usr/lib/X11/misc,/usr/lib/X11/75dpi,/usr/lib/X11/100dpi,dir

where dir is the directory that you built the new fonts.
