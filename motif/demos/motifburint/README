This directory contains the sample UIL/Xm program, motifburger.
This program is not complete.  It is a port of the XUI demo program.
It does compile and execute, but all callbacks (specifically the
APPLY button and the up and down drinks callbacks) are not correct.

Motifburger's UIL file includes a reference to Adobe's 14 point 
Courier Bold font.  If this font is not available on your system, 
you will see warnings when motifburger attempts to load this
font.  You can eliminate the warnings by substituting the font of
your choice in $LANG/motifblang.uil and rebuilding $LANG/motifblang.uil.

Motifburint will display the standard motifburger interface in your
choice of 4 variations. You can choose a kanji, hebrew, french,
or english interface. To set the type of interface set the variable
$LANG to one of the following:

	$LANG		Type of Interface
	-----		-----------------
	japan		kanji interface using fonts in ../demos/fonts.
	hebrew		hebrew interface using fonts in ../demos/fonts.
	french		a french interface.
	english		standard english interface.
