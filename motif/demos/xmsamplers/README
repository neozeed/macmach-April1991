	NOTES:
 
	1)	XMdemos.ad MUST be put in the app-defaults area before the
		xmdialogs demo will work.  The file should be named XMdemos.
                Usually the app-defaults area is /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.
                The demo will run without the defaults, but the buttons for
                creating and managing the dialogs will not appear.   Make
                install will correctly place the defaults file.

	2)	The xmfonts demo defaults to displaying the fonts whose
		name length are less than 10 characters. On some systems, 
		the font path contains only long XLFD font names. It may be 
		necessary either to set the resource xmfonts*maxLen to a
		bigger number (80), and to specify a numColumns resource
		of 1, or to add a fonts.alias file with the reserved keyword 
		FILE_NAMES_ALIASES in your font directory.

	3)	For xmter, you'll have to tell your favorite window-manager
		to remove all the window decorations. For mwm, it's already
		done by the program itself.

	If you notice any bugs in this demo, please see the bug list in
	the Release Notes to see if the problem is a known Toolkit defect.
