README for The Periodic Table of Motif Widgets


			       PERIODIC
			       --------

	This directory contains the sources for periodic.  Periodic is a
	demo of the displayable widgets in Motif.  Periodic presents many
	Motif widgets for your visual and sensual enjoyment.

	Periodic uses UIL.  I have provided support for both the MIT and
	Adobe fonts in the UIL file.  To change to Adobe font, comment the
	lines that refer to the MIT fonts and text locations.  Then,
	uncomment the lines that refer to the Adobe font and text locations.

	Known Bugs:

	1)  There may be 'unaligned data access' errors on startup.

	2)  I know that the real periodic table has the elements numbered
		horizontally.


	Enjoy,

	Michael K. Yee


If you notice any other bugs in this demo, please see the bug list in
