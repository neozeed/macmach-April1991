Purpose of this Release

        The contents of this package comprise the first patch
	release to OSF/Motif 1.1.  This patch release  
	is available only to licensees with software support
	contracts.  It has been designated version 1.1.1.
	
	OSF/Motif 1.1.1 contains source code that address 200 bugs
	reported against version 1.1. and prior releases. 

What to Expect From Motif 1.1.1 Patch Release

        The primary intent of this patch release is to insure that Motif 
        1.1.1 will pass the associated OSF/Motif VTS Test Suite (VTS) 1.0, 
        being released simultaneously.  This is a substantial effort that has 
        affected many areas of the Motif code as well as the AES document.

        Beyond all the VTS work done on Motif, there has been some effort put 
        into fixing very high priority bugs.  This effort includes fixes in 
        just about every area of Motif including the test suite, demos, libXm, 
        the AES, Uil/Mrm, and general compilation clean-ups.

        In total, there are about 200 bug fixes included in this patch 
        (approximately half of which were made purposely for the VTS).

            is used at OSF to build the Motif 1.1.1 documentation.
            It has been changed in Motif 1.1.1 to build the
            OSF/Motif User's Guide in a format consistent with that
            of other Motif 1.1 documents.  This file is provided
            only for reference in building Motif documentation.  It
            is not expected to work without modifications on any
            platform, and it is not supported.

       For information on building, installing, and printing
       documentation, see the file ./doc/README distributed with
       Motif 1.1.

       Documents Available from Prentice Hall

       The Motif 1.1 versions of the OSF/Motif Programmer's Guide,
       OSF/Motif Programmer's Reference, and OSF/Motif Style Guide
       and Revision B of the OSF Application Environment
       Specification (AES) User Environment Volume have been
       published by Prentice Hall.  The OSF/Motif User's Guide was
       not revised for Motif 1.1; the Motif 1.0 version was
       published by Prentice Hall.  All five books are available
       from the publisher and in bookstores.

       A number of changes, described below, were made to the Motif
       1.1 reference pages in Motif 1.1.1.  These changes appear in
       the version of the Revision B AES published by Prentice Hall
       but not in the Motif 1.1 version of the OSF/Motif
       Programmer's Reference published by Prentice Hall.  The
       changes do appear in the OSF/Motif Programmer's Reference
       distributed with Motif 1.1.1.

       Changes to Reference Pages in Release 1.1.1

       Changes have been made to the Motif 1.1 reference pages in
       Motif 1.1.1.  Following is a list of the substantive
       changes, organized by reference page.  Unless noted, each
       change applies to the reference page in both the OSF/Motif
       Programmer's Reference and Revision B of the OSF Application
       Environment Specification (AES) User Environment Volume
       distributed with Motif 1.1.1.

       mwm    The functions f.quit_mwm and f.restart can apply only
              to root menus, not icon or window menus.  The
              functions f.lower and f.raise do not apply to the
              root context.

       Core   The default values for XmNaccelerators and
              XmNtranslations are dynamic, not NULL.

              The access for XmNinitialResourcesPersistent is C,
              not CG.

              XmNx and XmNy refer to the top left outside corner
              and are relative to the parent's top left inside
              corner.  XmNheight and XmNwidth exclude border width.

       RectObj
	      XmNx and XmNy refer to the top left outside corner
              and are relative to the parent's top left inside
              corner.  XmNheight and XmNwidth exclude border width.

       VendorShell
              Setting Core resource XmNheight, XmNwidth, or
              XmNborderWidth for either a VendorShell or its child
              sets that resource to the same value in both the
              parent and the child.  An application should always
              specify these resources for the child, not the
              parent.  For a child of a VendorShell, setting XmNx
              or XmNy sets the corresponding resource of the parent
              but does not change the child's position relative to
              the parent.  XtGetValues for the child's XmNx or XmNy
              yields the value of the corresponding resource in the
              parent.  The x and y coordinates of the child's upper
              left outside corner relative to the parent's upper
              left inside corner are both zero minus the value of
              XmNborderWidth.

              The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual
              allows a window manager to change or control the
              border width of a reparented top-level window.

       VirtualBindings
              A binding for KExtend is Ctrl Shift<Key>Space, not
              Shift<Key>Space.  Ctrl Shift<Key>Space is not a
              binding for KReselect.  This change is not in the
              AES.

       WMShell
	      The value of XmNwmTimeout must not be negative.

       XmArrowButton
              The event in the callback struct is not NULL for
              XmNactivateCallback callbacks.

              For the ArmAndActivate() action, the button is armed
              and the XmNarmCallback callbacks are called
              immediately; the button is activated and disarmed and
              the XmNactivateCallback and XmNdisarmCallback
              callbacks are called, either immediately or at a
              later time.

       XmArrowButtonGadget
              The event in the callback struct is not NULL for
              XmNactivateCallback callbacks.

              For the KActivate action, the button is armed and the
              XmNarmCallback callbacks are called immediately; the
              button is activated and disarmed and the
              XmNactivateCallback and XmNdisarmCallback callbacks
              are called, either immediately or at a later time.

       XmBulletinBoard
              The type of XmNcancelButton and XmNdefaultButton is
              Widget, not Window.

              XmNdialogStyle can be initialized or set only if the
              parent of the XmBulletinBoard is of class
              XmDialogShell.  Otherwise, the value is forced to
              XmDIALOG_WORK_AREA.  Setting the resource works only
              when the XmBulletinBoard is unmanaged.

              The access for Core resource XmNaccelerators is N/A,
              not CSG.

       XmCascadeButton
              The value of XmNmappingDelay must not be negative.

              XmPrimitive resource XmNtraversalOn is initialized to
              True; inside MenuBars, Popup MenuPanes, and Pulldown
              MenuPanes, it is forced to True.

       XmCascadeButtonGadget
              The value of XmNmappingDelay must not be negative.

              XmGadget resource XmNtraversalOn is initialized to
              True; inside MenuBars, Popup MenuPanes, and Pulldown
              MenuPanes, it is forced to True.

       XmCommand
              The value of XmNhistoryItemCount must not be
              negative.

              XtGetValues for XmNhistoryItems returns the list
              items themselves, not a copy of the list items.  This
              change is not in the AES.

              The value of XmNhistoryMaxItems must be positive.

              XmNhistoryVisibleItemCount overrides XmSelectionBox
              resource XmNlistVisibleItemCount, not
              XmNvisibleItemCount.  The default value for
              XmNhistoryVisibleItemCount is dynamic based on the
              height of the list.  The value must be positive.

       XmCreateOptionMenu
              ToggleButtons and ToggleButtonGadgets are not allowed
              in an OptionMenu's Pulldown MenuPane.  The results of
              including CascadeButtons and CascadeButtonGadgets are
              undefined.

       XmCreatePromptDialog
              The XmSelectionBox resource XmNdialogType is forced
              to XmDIALOG_PROMPT.

       XmCreateScrolledText
              The results of placing an XmText widget with
              XmNeditMode set to XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT inside a
              scrolled window are undefined.

       XmCreateSelectionDialog
              The XmSelectionBox resource XmNdialogType is forced
              to XmDIALOG_SELECTION.

       XmDialogShell
              Setting Core resource XmNheight, XmNwidth, or
              XmNborderWidth for either an XmDialogShell or its
              child sets that resource to the same value in both
              the parent and the child.  An application should
              always specify these resources for the child, not the
              parent.  For a child of an XmDialogShell, setting
              XmNx or XmNy sets the corresponding resource of the
              parent but does not change the child's position
              relative to the parent.  XtGetValues for the child's
              XmNx or XmNy yields the value of the corresponding
              resource in the parent.  The x and y coordinates of
              the child's upper left outside corner relative to the
              parent's upper left inside corner are both zero minus
              the value of XmNborderWidth.

              The Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual
              allows a window manager to change or control the
              border width of a reparented top-level window.

       XmDrawingArea
              An application must not draw in the shadow and must
              clear the old shadow when the widget is resized.

              For the DrawingAreaInput() action, the
              XmNinputCallback callbacks are not called when the
              input occurs in a gadget.

       XmDrawnButton
              The access for XmLabel resources XmNmnemonic and
              XmNmnemonicCharSet is N/A, not CSG.

              The default value for XmPrimitive resource
              XmNhighlightThickness is 2, not 0.

              The event in the callback struct is not NULL for
              XmNactivateCallback callbacks.

              For the ArmAndActivate() action, the button is armed
              and the XmNarmCallback callbacks are called
              immediately; the button is activated and disarmed and
              the XmNactivateCallback and XmNdisarmCallback
              callbacks are called, either immediately or at a
              later time.

       XmFileSelectionBox
              The directory mask can contain zero or more
              wildcards.

              Data returned by the XmNqualifySearchDataProc may be
              modified by the XmNdirSearchProc.

              The value of XmNdirListItemCount and
              XmNfileListItemCount must not be negative.

              XtGetValues for XmNdirListItems and XmNfileListItems
              returns the list items themselves, not a copy of the
              list items.  This change is not in the AES.

              The access for XmNdirectoryValid, XmNdirListItems,
              XmNdirListItemCount, XmNfileListItems,
              XmNfileListItemCount, and XmNlistUpdated is SG, not
              CSG.

              The default value for XmNnoMatchString is " [    ] "
              (with 4 spaces between the brackets).

              XmNdirSpec is the same as the XmSelectionBox resource
              XmNtextString; XmNfileListItems is the same as
              XmNlistItems; XmNfileListItemCount is the same as
              XmNlistItemCount; and XmNfileListLabelString is the
              same as XmNlistLabelString.

              The default values for XmSelectionBox resources
              XmNlistItems, XmNlistItemCount, and XmNtextString are
              dynamic.

       XmForm For XmNbottomAttachment and XmNbottomPosition: when
              XmNbottomAttachment is XmATTACH_POSITION, the
              position of the bottom side of the child is relative
              to the top side of the XmForm, not the bottom side of
              the XmForm.  For XmNrightAttachment and
              XmNrightPosition: when XmNrightAttachment is
              XmATTACH_POSITION, the position of the right side of
              the child is relative to the left side of the XmForm,
              not the right side of the XmForm.

              The type of XmNbottomWidget, XmNleftWidget,
              XmNrightWidget, and XmNtopWidget is Widget, not
              Window.

              The value of XmNfractionBase must not be zero.

              The access for Core resource XmNaccelerators is N/A,
              not CSG.

       XmFrame
	      The XmFrame's width and height are the child's outer
              width and height plus the XmFrame's margins and
              shadow thickness.

              When the parent of the XmFrame is a shell, the
              default value for the XmManager resource
              XmNshadowThickness is 1.  When the parent is not a
              shell, the default is 2.

       XmGadget
              The access for Core resource XmNborderWidth is N/A,
              not CSG, for XmGadget and its subclasses.

       XmGetPixmap
              If the image_name argument begins with a /, it is
              taken to be a full pathname specification and is the
              only pathname searched.

       XmLabel
	      If the parent is an XmRowColumn whose XmNisAligned is
              True, XmNalignment is forced to the value of the
              XmRowColumn's XmNentryAlignment if the XmRowColumn's
              XmNrowColumnType is XmWORK_AREA or if the widget is a
              subclass of XmLabel.

              Documentation for XmNrecomputeSize no longer lists
              the specific resources whose changes cause resizing
              when the value of XmNrecomputeSize is True.

              XmPrimitive resource XmNtraversalOn is forced to
              False inside menus and defaults to False otherwise.

       XmLabelGadget
              If the parent is an XmRowColumn whose XmNisAligned is
              True, XmNalignment is forced to the value of the
              XmRowColumn's XmNentryAlignment if the XmRowColumn's
              XmNrowColumnType is XmWORK_AREA or if the widget is a
              subclass of XmLabelGadget.

              Documentation for XmNrecomputeSize no longer lists
              the specific resources whose changes cause resizing
              when the value of XmNrecomputeSize is True.

              XmGadget resource XmNtraversalOn is forced to False
              inside menus and defaults to False otherwise.

       XmList The value of XmNdoubleClickInterval, XmNitemCount,
              and XmNselectedItemCount must not be negative.  The
              value of XmNtopPosition and XmNvisibleItemCount must
              be positive.

              XtGetValues for XmNitems and XmNselectedItems returns
              the list items themselves, not a copy of the list
              items.  This change is not in the AES.

              The type for XmNvisibleItemCount is int, not short.

       XmMainWindow
              The type of XmNcommandWindow, XmNmenuBar, and
              XmNmessageWindow is Widget, not Window.

              The access for XmScrolledWindow resources
              XmNscrolledWindowMarginHeight and
              XmNscrolledWindowMarginWidth is N/A, not CSG.

       XmMenuShell
              Setting Core resource XmNheight, XmNwidth, or
              XmNborderWidth for either an XmMenuShell or its child
              sets that resource to the same value in both the
              parent and the child.  An application should always
              specify these resources for the child, not the
              parent.  For a child of an XmMenuShell, setting XmNx
              or XmNy sets the corresponding resource of the parent
              but does not change the child's position relative to
              the parent.  XtGetValues for the child's XmNx or XmNy
              yields the value of the corresponding resource in the
              parent.  The x and y coordinates of the child's upper
              left outside corner relative to the parent's upper
              left inside corner are both zero minus the value of
              XmNborderWidth.

       XmMessageBox
              The access for Core resource XmNaccelerators is N/A,
              not CSG.

       XmProcessTraversal
              It is not possible to use XmProcessTraversal to
              traverse to MenuBars and Pulldown or Popup MenuPanes.

       XmPushButton
              The default value for XmNdefaultButtonShadowThickness
              is dynamic.  If XmNshowAsDefault is 0, the default is
              0; if XmNshowAsDefault is greater than 0, that value
              is the default for XmNdefaultButtonShadowThickness.

              The default value for XmLabel resource XmNlabelPixmap
              is dynamic, not XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP.  If
              XmNlabelType is XmPIXMAP and an initial value is
              specified for XmNarmPixmap but not XmNlabelPixmap,
              the XmNarmPixmap value is used for XmNlabelPixmap.

              For the ArmAndActivate() action, the button is armed
              and the XmNarmCallback callbacks are called
              immediately.  The button is activated and disarmed
              and the XmNactivateCallback and XmNdisarmCallback
              callbacks are called; inside a menu this happens
              immediately, and outside a menu it happens either
              immediately or at a later time.

       XmPushButtonGadget
              The default value for XmNdefaultButtonShadowThickness
              is dynamic.  If XmNshowAsDefault is 0, the default is
              0; if XmNshowAsDefault is greater than 0, that value
              is the default for XmNdefaultButtonShadowThickness.

              The default value for XmLabelGadget resource
              XmNlabelPixmap is dynamic, not XmUNSPECIFIED_PIXMAP.
              If XmNlabelType is XmPIXMAP and an initial value is
              specified for XmNarmPixmap but not XmNlabelPixmap,
              the XmNarmPixmap value is used for XmNlabelPixmap.

              For the KActivate() action, the button is armed and
              the XmNarmCallback callbacks are called immediately.
              The button is activated and disarmed and the
              XmNactivateCallback and XmNdisarmCallback callbacks
              are called; inside a menu this happens immediately,
              and outside a menu it happens either immediately or
              at a later time.

       XmRowColumn
              The access for XmNisHomogeneous is CG, not CSG.  The
              value is forced to True when XmNrowColumnType is
              XmMENU_BAR, or when XmNrowColumnType is XmWORK_AREA
              and XmNradioBehavior is True.  It is forced to False
              when XmNrowColumnType is XmMENU_OPTION.

              The value of XmNnumColumns must be positive.  When
              XmNrowColumnType is XmMENU_OPTION, XmNnumColumns is
              forced to 1.

              When XmNrowColumnType is XmMENU_OPTION,
              XmNorientation defaults to XmHORIZONTAL.  When
              XmNrowColumnType is XmMENU_BAR, the results of
              specifying a value of XmVERTICAL for XmNorientation
              are undefined.

              When XmNrowColumnType is XmMENU_OPTION, XmNpacking is
              initialized to XmPACK_TIGHT.

              Button type XmCASCADEBUTTON is not allowed when
              creating simple option menus.  This change is not in
              the AES.

              The value of the simple menu creation resources
              XmNbuttonCount, XmNbuttonSet, and XmNpostFromButton
              must not be negative.  This change is not in the AES.

              When XmNrowColumnType is XmWORK_AREA, XmManager
              resource XmNnavigationType defaults to XmTAB_GROUP.
              When XmNrowColumnType is XmMENU_OPTION,
              XmNnavigationType defaults to XmNONE.  Otherwise,
              XmNnavigationType is not applicable and its use is
              undefined.

              When XmNrowColumnType is XmMENU_BAR, XmMENU_PULLDOWN,
              or XmMENU_POPUP, XmManager resource XmNtraversalOn is
              initialized to False and cannot be changed by
              XtSetValues.

              The XmManager resource XmNshadowThickness defaults to
              2 when XmNrowColumnType is XmMENU_POPUP,
              XmMENU_PULLDOWN, and XmMENU_BAR; it is N/A and its
              use is undefined when XmNrowColumnType is XmWORK_AREA
              or XmMENU_OPTION.

              If the parent is an XmMenuShell, the Core resource
              XmNmappedWhenManaged is forced to False on
              realization.

       XmScale
	      The value of XmNdecimalPoints must not be negative.

              XmNvalue is constrained to be between XmNminimum and
              XmNmaximum, inclusive.

              The default value for XmManager resource
              XmNshadowThickness is 2, not 0.

       XmScrollBar
              The value of XmNincrement, XmNinitialDelay,
              XmNpageIncrement, and XmNrepeatDelay must be
              positive.

              The access for XmNpageIncrement is CSG, not C.  The
              access for XmNpageDecrementCallback is C, not CSG.

              The default value for XmNsliderSize is (XmNmaximum -
              XmNminimum) / 10, with a minimum of 1.

              XmNvalue is constrained to be between XmNminimum and
              (XmNmaximum - XmNsliderSize), inclusive.

              For the the IncrementDownOrRight(),
              IncrementUpOrLeft(), PageDownOrRight(), and
              PageUpOrLeft() actions, an argument of 0 moves the
              slider only up or down; an argument of 1 moves the
              slider only left or right.

       XmScrolledWindow
              The default values for XmNclipWindow,
              XmNhorizontalScrollBar, and XmNverticalScrollBar are
              dynamic, not NULL.  Horizontal and vertical scroll
              bars are created if XmNscrollingPolicy is
              XmAUTOMATIC.  A clip window is created if
              XmNvisualPolicy is XmCONSTANT.

              The type of XmNclipWindow, XmNhorizontalScrollBar,
              XmNverticalScrollBar, and XmNworkWindow is Widget,
              not Window.

       XmSelectionBox
              The value of XmNlistItemCount must not be negative.

              XtGetValues for XmNlistItems returns the list items
              themselves, not a copy of the list items.  This
              change is not in the AES.

              The default value for XmNlistLabelString is dynamic.
              The default is "Items" unless XmNdialogType is
              XmDIALOG_PROMPT; in this case the default is NULL.

              The default value for XmNlistVisibleItemCount is
              dynamic based on the height of the list.  The value
              must be positive unless XmNdialogType is
              XmDIALOG_PROMPT; in this case the value is always 0.

              The default value for XmNtextColumns is dynamic, not
              20.  The value must be positive.

              The default value for the XmBulletinBoard resource
              XmNcancelButton is the Cancel button unless
              XmNdialogType is XmDIALOG_COMMAND, when the default
              is NULL.  The default value for the XmBulletinBoard
              resource XmNdefaultButton is the OK button unless
              XmNdialogType is XmDIALOG_COMMAND, when the default
              is NULL.

       XmSeparator
              The access for XmPrimitive resource XmNtraversalOn is
              G, not CSG.

       XmSeparatorGadget
              The access for XmGadget resource XmNtraversalOn is G,
              not CSG.

       XmString 
              XtGetValues on a resource whose type is XmString
              yields a copy of the resource value, which the
              application must free.

       XmText The results of placing an XmText widget with
              XmNeditMode set to XmSINGLE_LINE_EDIT inside a
              scrolled window are undefined.

              The value of XmNblinkRate, XmNselectionArrayCount,
              and XmNselectThreshold must not be negative.

              If no width is specified, XmNcolumns defaults to 20.
              The value must be positive.

              The values of XmNmarginHeight and XmNmarginWidth are
              not forced when the widget is inside an
              XmScrolledWindow.

              If no height is specified, XmNrows defaults to 1.
              The value must be positive.

              If the XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, the line of
              text that contains XmNtopCharacter is displayed at
              the top of the widget without shifting the text left
              or right.  XtGetValues for XmNtopCharacter returns
              the position of the first character in the line that
              is displayed at the top of the widget.

       XmTextField
              The value of XmNblinkRate, XmNselectionArrayCount,
              and XmNselectThreshold must not be negative.

              If no width is specified, XmNcolumns defaults to 20.
              The value must be positive.

              The values of XmNmarginHeight and XmNmarginWidth are
              not forced when the widget is inside an
              XmScrolledWindow.

       XmTextSetTopCharacter
              If the XmNeditMode is XmMULTI_LINE_EDIT, the line of
              text that contains top_character is displayed at the
              top of the widget without shifting the text left or
              right.

       XmToggleButton
              The default value for XmNindicatorSize is dynamic.
              If no value is specified, the size of the indicator
              is based on the size of the label string or pixmap.
              If the label string or pixmap changes, the size of
              the indicator is recomputed based on the size of the
              label string or pixmap.  Once a value has been
              specified for XmNindicatorSize, the indicator has
              that size, regardless of the size of the label string
              or pixmap, until a new value is specified.

              Initializing or setting XmNselectInsensitivePixmap
              also sets the XmLabel resource
              XmNlabelInsensitivePixmap.  Initializing or setting
              XmNselectPixmap also sets the XmLabel resource
              XmNlabelPixmap.

              The translations for KActivate and KSelect in a menu
              invoke the ArmAndActivate() action, not the
              KeySelect() action.

              For the ArmAndActivate() action, the XmNarmCallback,
              XmNvalueChangedCallback, and XmNdisarmCallback
              callbacks are called.

       XmToggleButtonGadget
              The default value for XmNindicatorSize is dynamic.
              If no value is specified, the size of the indicator
              is based on the size of the label string or pixmap.
              If the label string or pixmap changes, the size of
              the indicator is recomputed based on the size of the
              label string or pixmap.  Once a value has been
              specified for XmNindicatorSize, the indicator has
              that size, regardless of the size of the label string
              or pixmap, until a new value is specified.

              Initializing or setting XmNselectInsensitivePixmap
              also sets the XmLabelGadget resource
              XmNlabelInsensitivePixmap.  Initializing or setting
              XmNselectPixmap also sets the XmLabelGadget resource
              XmNlabelPixmap.

              For the KActivate action, the XmNarmCallback,
              XmNvalueChangedCallback, and XmNdisarmCallback
              callbacks are called.

       XmVaCreateSimpleOptionMenu
              Button type XmVaCASCADEBUTTON is not allowed when
              creating simple option menus.  This change is not in
              the AES.



	
Overview of the Motif Directory Structure

       The Motif directory structure is outlined below.

       The file ./README-1.1.1 summarizes the contents of the top level
       directories in the directory structure, briefly describes
       the build process, and describes bug reporting procedures.

       The file ./BUGREPORT is a bug report template.  This tem-
       plate has changed since the last release to clarify severity
       levels.

       The file ./OPENBUGS contains a list of the important bugs
       currently open against OSF/Motif.

       The directory ./X11R4 contains official MIT patches for Ver-
       sion 11, Release 4 of the X Window System, as well as one
       OSF patch.  The patches to Xlib and the X Toolkit Intrinsics 
       are required for building and running Motif 1.1.1.  The file 
       ./X11R4/README-1.1.1 describes the MIT patches and the OSF patch
        and how to apply them to your X sources.  For more information on 
       these patches, see the section ``Building Motif for Your System'' below.

       NOTE: MIT, not OSF, is responsible for support of patches
       15-18 in the ./X11R4 directory.  We provide them unsupported,
       only for the convenience of users who might not yet have
       received the latest sources.

       The directory ./doc contains all relevant documentation.
       This directory also contains a script called build.docs
       which can be used to create ASCII and PostScript output for
       all relevant documents. 

       The directory ./lib contains patched files for the toolkit 
       library and resource manager library:

          * ./lib/Xm contains patched files for the Motif widget library.

          * ./lib/Mrm contains patched files for the Motif resource manager 
	    library used with the uil compiler.

       The directory ./clients contains the Motif window manager,
       the User Interface Language (uil) compiler:

          * ./clients/uil contains patched files for the uil compiler and the 
	    callable uil interface library (libUil.a).

          * ./clients/mwm contains patched files for the Motif window manager.  

       The directory ./demos is an unsupported directory. This
       directory contains several demo subdirectories with patched files.

       The directory ./tests contains patched files for the test suites.  

       The directory ./tools contains a single tools subdirectory,
       wml, with patched files for the Widget Meta-Language (WML) facility.

Building Motif for Your System

       Motif 1.1.1 uses X11R4 Xlib and X Toolkit Intrinsics
       libraries.  The versions of these libraries used to build
       Motif must have all the official MIT patches and the OSF
       patch applied to them in order for Motif to build and run 
       properly.  The patches that are distributed with this
       version of OSF/Motif are MIT fixes 15 through 18 and an
       OSF patch called fix-osf-1.1.1.

       In order to build Motif 1.1.1 you should use the same 
       configuration (location of header files, libraries, etc.)
       as you did when you built Motif 1.1.  Any tailoring that
       was done to your build configuration will remain the same.
       For more information on customizing your OSF/Motif build
       environment consult the Release Notes or ./README that you
       received with OSF/Motif 1.1.
 

       The procedure for building Motif 1.1.1 has two steps:

          * Patching the X11R4 libraries (which includes backing out
	    fix-osf from the OSF/Motif 1.1 release).  This is explained 
	    in the next section.

          * Building Motif 1.1.1.  The build procedure is explained in detail 
	    in the Motif 1.1 release notes, and briefly described below. 

       Patching the X11R4 Libraries

       You must apply the patches supplied in the ./X11R4 directory
       to the X11R4 sources.  If you do not have the X11R4 sources,
       you can arrange to obtain them by writing to this address:

            MIT X Consortium
            Laboratory for Computer Science
            545 Technology Square
            Cambridge, MA  02139

       To apply the patches, you may want to use the patch program
       that appears in the ./util/patch directory from the OSF/Motif 1.1
       release.  This directory was copied unmodified from the MIT X11R4 
       distribution and is provided only as a convenience to Motif users.

       To use the patch program you must first build it by moving
       to the directory ./util/patch and following the instructions
       in the README file there.  

       Once you have built the patch program for your system, you are ready 
       back out the fix-osf distributed with the OSF/Motif 1.1 release and 
       apply the new patches to your MIT X11R4 sources.  These patches are 
       contained in the files ./X11R4/fix*.  
       Change directory to the top of your X11R4 sources:

            cd X11R4-source-top-level

       You should copy the fix-osf from the OSF/Motif 1.1 release into
       that directory and then use the patch program with the -R option
       to back out the patch:

	    cp Motif-1.1-source-top-level/X11R4/fix-osf .
	
	    patch -R -p1 < fix-osf

       Then copy the new patches to that directory:

            cp Motif-1.1.1-source-top-level/X11R4/fix* .

       Run the patch program, applying the MIT patches in ascending
       numerical order.  Use the appropriate pathname strip count
       to remove the correct number of leading directory names from
       the pathname in the patch.  For example, assume that the
       patch file pathname contains mit/lib/Xt, and your sources to
       be patched are in ./lib/Xt.  To apply all patches 15 through 18, 
       stripping the first directory name from the pathname in the
       patch, you might use the following from a C shell:

            @ i=15
            while ($i <= 18)
              patch -p1 < fix-$i
              @ i++
            end

       After applying the 18 MIT patches, you must apply the OSF
       patch:

            patch -p1 < fix-osf-1.1.1

       After applying all patches to the X11 and Xt library
       sources, you should rebuild and re-install those libraries
       if necessary.

       Note that the patches contain fixes for multiple source
       files, including those in such libraries as Xaw and Xmu.  If
       you do not have sources for a file affected by the patch,
       the patch program issues a query for a file to patch.
       Pressing <Return> at the query and then y<Return> at the
       ``Skip this patch?'' query bypasses the file in question.


       Building Motif 1.1.1
       
       Once the X11R4 libraries have been patched (and installed
       if necessary), you are ready to re-build Motif with the
       1.1.1 updates.  To do this you should copy the new files
       over the files in your existing Motif 1.1 source tree. 
       To do this you will need write permission on the files 
       which are being overwritten:

	    cd Motif-1.1-source-top-level

	    cp -r Motif-1.1.1-source-top-level/* .

       If this command won't work on your system because it complains
       about overwriting existing directories, then you may need to
       copy a directory at a time or use a 'find' script.


       Once the new files have been placed in your Motif source
       tree you can begin to recompile.  There is no need to 
       rebuild the Makefiles, the include links, or the dependency
       lists (make Makefiles, includes, depend).  To begin the
       compilation from the root of the source tree use the command:

            make

       This will compile the entire tree, except for the test suites.  


       The command

            make install

       compiles and installs the entire tree, except for the test
       suites.  The installer must be the superuser.  Make sure the
       files and directories the superuser creates can be read by
       all.  Installing Motif overwrites the previous Motif instal-
       lation.

       If you want to compile and install the test suites, you must 
       add the word tests to the end of the SUBDIRS list in the top-level 
       Makefile before running make install.
