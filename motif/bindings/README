These files were provided by various vendors, though not necessarily
the vendors whose hardware they apply to.  Each file contains a set of
keyboard bindings that is suggested for use on that particular
server/hardware combination.  These files should be used as examples 
of ~/.motifbind files to work from.

By copying the appropriate file into the user's home directory and
renaming it to ".motifbind", the bindings will be recognized and used
when the Motif window manager is (re)started.
These bindings will override any other default bindings except those 
initiated within a client application (using XtOverrideTranslations).

These examples are provided, as is, only as a service to the vendors
and users.
