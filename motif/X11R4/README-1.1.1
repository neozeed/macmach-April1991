The patches shipped with this release of OSF/Motif include fix-patches 
15 through 18.  The fix-patches are available from the MIT X Consortium.  
An OSF patch, called fix-osf-1.1.1, is also included.  Since MIT is no 
longer issuing R4 patches, this fix won't be available from the X
Consortium.

The fix-osf-1.1.1 patch fixes problems found at OSF dealing with cutting 
a primary selection from one text widget and primary pasting that selection 
to another text widget in the same client. When this was done, any other
primary selection in the first text widget would leave multiple primary
highlights and selections and further primary cuts and pastes would
be corrupted. This problem was introduced in Patch 15 - 18 that was
released by MIT.  Therefore this patch should be applied after the MIT
patches.

The patches which are relevant to Xlib (lib/X) and the Xt Intrinsics 
(lib/Xt) must be applied to the X11 Release 4 source in order to build 
and run OSF/Motif 1.1.1.  Note that you must back out fix-osf which
was distributed with OSF/Motif 1.1 before you apply the MIT fixes 15
through 18.  Instructions for doing this are given below.

In order to apply the patches, you may want to use the patch tool
that appears the the ./util/patch directory of the Motif release.
This directory was copied unmodified from the MIT X11 Release 4
distribution and is only provided here as a convenience to users.

To use the patch program you must first build it by moving to the
directory ./util/patch and following the instructions in the README
file.  

Once you have built the patch program for your system, you are ready
back out the fix-osf distributed with the OSF/Motif 1.1 release and
apply the new patches to your MIT X11R4 sources.  These patches are
contained in the files ./X11R4/fix*.
Change directory to the top of your X11R4 sources:

        cd X11R4-source-top-level

You should copy the fix-osf from the OSF/Motif 1.1 release into
that directory and then use the patch program with the -R option
to back out the patch:

	cp Motif-1.1-source-top-level/X11R4/fix-osf .

	patch -R -p1 < fix-osf


Then copy the new patches to that directory:

        cp Motif-1.1.1-source-top-level/X11R4/fix* .

Run the patch program, applying the numbered patches in ascending numerical
order, then apply the OSF patch.  Use the appropriate pathname strip count 
to remove the correct number of leading directory names from the pathname in
the patch.  For example, to apply all MIT patches 15 through 18 and strip
the first directory name from the pathname in the patch (the patch
file contains mit/lib/Xt and your files are in ./lib/Xt) you might
use the following from the c-shell:

	@ i=15
	while ($i <= 18)
	  patch -p1 < fix-$i
	  @ i++
	end

You should then apply the OSF patch using the following command from
the c-shell:

	patch -p1 < fix-osf-1.1.1
