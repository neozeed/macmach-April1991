       Part of the charter of the Open Software FoundationTM
       (OSFTM) is to foster the development of portable software
       that will run on a variety of hardware platforms.  The
       Application Environment Specification (AES) specifies the
       interfaces that support such software.

       Specifically, this document (the Application Environment
       Specification (AES) User Environment Volume, Revision B)
       specifies interfaces for the user environment portion of
       OSF's Applications Environment.

       Chapter 1 describes the purpose of the Application Environ-
       ment Specification, incorporating a document originally pub-
       lished by itself as "The AES Definition."  It provides a
       detailed description of the relationship of the AES to:

          +o Formal (de jure) standards and specifications.

          +o Implementations; for example, operating systems like
            OSF's operating system component (OSC).

          +o Portable applications software.

       This document is written for:

          +o Software engineers developing AES-compliant applica-
            tions to run on AES-compliant implementations.

          +o Software engineers developing AES-compliant implementa-
            tions on which AES-compliant applications can run.

          +o Organizations (for example, standards-setting bodies)
            for whom the AES (or some part of it) is an appropriate
            part of the formal, de jure process.

       This document is organized into two chapters.

          +o _C_h_a_p_t_e_r _1 introduces the AES, providing the general AES
            definition, and the general rationale for inclusion and
            specification of interfaces in the AES.  This chapter
            includes the AES Service Outline.

          +o _C_h_a_p_t_e_r _2 contains manual pages for all of the AES/UE
            interfaces.  They are ordered alphabetically within
            commands and functions.

            as they appear.

          +o _I_t_a_l_i_c_i_z_e_d strings represent variables (for example,
            function or macro arguments).

          +o Ellipses (...) indicate that additional arguments are
            optional.

                 This section gives a short description of the

                 This section indicates whether the interfaces's
                 AES support status is full-, trial-, or
                 temporary-use.

                 specifications in which the interface exists.

                 This section describes the behavior of the inter-
                 face.  On widget man pages there are tables of
                 resource values in the descriptions.  Those tables
                 have the following headers:

                 NNNNaaaammmmeeee      Contains the name of the resource.  Each
                           new resource is described following the
                           new resources table.
                 CCCCllllaaaassssssss     Contains the class of the resource.
                 TTTTyyyyppppeeee      Contains the type of the resource.
                 DDDDeeeeffffaaaauuuulllltttt   Contains the default value of the
                           resource.
                 AAAAcccccccceeeessssssss    Contains the access permissions for the
                           resource.  A CCCC in this column means the
                           resource can be set at widget creation
                           time.  An SSSS means the resource can be
                           set anytime.  A GGGG means the resource's
                           value can retrieved.

                 faces.

                 This section provides cross references to related
                 interfaces and header files described within this
