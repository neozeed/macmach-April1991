.SH NAME
\fBXmPushButton \(em the PushButton widget class.\fP
.iX "XmPushButton"
.iX "widget class" "PushButton"
.sp 1
.SH "AES SUPPORT LEVEL"
Full-use
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <Xm/PushB.h>\fP
.sp 1
.SH DESCRIPTION
PushButton issues commands within an application.
It consists of a text label or pixmap surrounded
by a border shadow. 
When a PushButton is selected, the shadow changes to give the appearance
that it has been pressed in.  When a PushButton is 
unselected, the shadow changes to give the appearance that it is out.
.PP
The default behavior associated with a PushButton in a menu depends on
the type of menu system in which it resides.
By default, \fBBSelect\fP controls the behavior of the PushButton.
In addition, \fBBMenu\fP controls the behavior of the PushButton if
it resides in a PopupMenu system.
The actual mouse button used is determined by its RowColumn parent.
.PP
Thickness for a second shadow, used when the PushButton is the default
button,  may be specified by using the 
\fBXmNshowAsDefault\fP resource.  If it has a non-zero value, the Label's
resources \fBXmNmarginLeft\fP, \fBXmNmarginRight\fP, \fBXmNmarginTop\fP, and
\fBXmNmarginBottom\fP may be modified to accommodate the second shadow.
.PP
If an initial value is specified for \fBXmNarmPixmap\fP but not for
\fBXmNlabelPixmap\fP, the \fBXmNarmPixmap\fP value is used for
\fBXmNlabelPixmap\fP.
.sp 1
.SS "Classes"
PushButton inherits behavior and resources from \fBCore\fP, \fBXmPrimitive\fP, 
and \fBXmLabel\fP Classes.
.PP
The class pointer is \fBxmPushButtonWidgetClass\fP. 
.PP
The class name is \fBXmPushButton\fP.
.sp 1
.SS "New Resources"
The following table defines a set of widget resources used by the programmer
to specify data.  The programmer can also set the resource values for the 
inherited classes to set attributes for this widget.  To reference a
resource by name or by class in a .Xdefaults file, remove the \fBXmN\fP or
\fBXmC\fP prefix and use the remaining letters.  To specify one of the defined 
values for a resource in a .Xdefaults file, remove the \fBXm\fP prefix and use
the remaining letters (in either lowercase or uppercase, but include any
underscores between words).
The codes in the access column indicate if the given resource can be
set at creation time (\fBC\fP),
set by using \fBXtSetValues\fP (\fBS\fP), 
retrieved by using \fBXtGetValues\fP (\fBG\fP), or is not applicable (\fBN/A\fP).

.IP "\fBXmNactivateCallback\fP"
Specifies the list of callbacks that is called when PushButton is activated.
PushButton is activated when the user presses
and releases the active mouse button 
while the pointer is inside that widget.  Activating the PushButton
also disarms it.
For this callback the reason is \fBXmCR_ACTIVATE\fP.
.IP "\fBXmNarmCallback\fP"
Specifies the list of callbacks that is called when PushButton is armed.
PushButton is armed when the user presses
the active mouse button while the pointer is inside that
widget. 
For this callback the reason is \fBXmCR_ARM\fP.
.br
.ne 3
.IP "\fBXmNarmColor\fP"
Specifies the color with which to fill the armed button.
\fBXmNfillOnArm\fP must be set to True for this resource to have an effect.
The default for a color display is a color between the background and the
bottom shadow color.  For a monochrome display, the default is set to the
foreground color, and any text in the label appears in the background
color when the button is armed.
.IP "\fBXmNarmPixmap\fP"
Specifies the pixmap to be used as the button face if \fBXmNlabelType\fP is
\fBXmPIXMAP\fP and PushButton is armed.  This resource is disabled when the  
PushButton is in a menu.
.IP "\fBXmNdefaultButtonShadowThickness\fP"
This resource specifies the width of the default button indicator shadow.
If this resource is zero, the width of the shadow comes from the value of
the \fBXmNshowAsDefault\fP resource.  If this resource is greater than
zero, the \fBXmNshowAsDefault\fP resource is only used to specify whether
this button is the default.
The default value is the initial value of \fBXmNshowAsDefault\fP.
.IP "\fBXmNdisarmCallback\fP"
Specifies the list of callbacks
that is called when PushButton is disarmed.  PushButton is disarmed when
the user presses and releases the active mouse button
while the pointer is inside that widget.  For this callback, the reason is
\fBXmCR_DISARM\fP.
.IP "\fBXmNfillOnArm\fP"
Forces the PushButton to fill the background of the button with the
color specified by \fBXmNarmColor\fP when the button is armed and when this
resource is set to True.  If False, only the top and bottom
shadow colors are switched.  
When the PushButton is in a menu, this resource is ignored and assumed to be
False.
.IP "\fBXmNmultiClick\fP"
If a button click is followed by another button click within the time
span specified by the display's multi-click time, and this resource is
set to \fBXmMULTICLICK_DISCARD\fP, do not process the second click.
If this resource is set to \fBXmMULTICLICK_KEEP\fP, process the event
and increment \fIclick_count\fP in the callback structure.
When the button is not in a menu, the default value is
\fBXmMULTICLICK_KEEP\fP.
.IP "\fBXmNshowAsDefault\fP"
If \fBXmNdefaultButtonShadowThickness\fP is greater than zero, a value
greater than zero in this resource
specifies to mark this button as the default button.
If \fBXmNdefaultButtonShadowThickness\fP is zero, a value greater than
zero in this resource specifies to mark this button as the default
button with the shadow thickness specified by this resource.
The space between
the shadow and the default shadow is equal to the sum of both shadows. 
The default value is zero.  When this value is not zero, the Label
resources \fBXmNmarginLeft\fP, \fBXmNmarginRight\fP, \fBXmNmarginTop\fP, and
\fBXmNmarginBottom\fP may be modified to accommodate the second shadow.
This resource is disabled when the PushButton is in a menu.

.SS "Inherited Resources"
PushButton inherits behavior and resources from the following   
superclasses.  For a complete description of each resource, refer to the
man page for that superclass.

This action arms the PushButton.
It draws the shadow in the armed state.
If the button is not in a menu and if \fBXmNfillOnArm\fP is set
to True, it fills the button with the color specified by
\fBXmNarmColor\fP.
If \fBXmNlabelType\fP is \fBXmPIXMAP\fP, the \fBXmNarmPixmap\fP is
used for the button face.
It calls the \fBXmNarmCallback\fP callbacks.

If \fBXmNlabelType\fP is \fBXmPIXMAP\fP, the \fBXmNarmPixmap\fP is
used for the button face.
Calls the \fBXmNarmCallback\fP callbacks.
.IP
Outside a menu, this action also arranges for the following to happen,
either immediately or at a later time:
The shadow is drawn in the unarmed state and, if \fBXmNfillOnArm\fP is set
to True, the background color reverts to the unarmed color.
If \fBXmNlabelType\fP is \fBXmPIXMAP\fP, the \fBXmNlabelPixmap\fP is
used for the button face.
The \fBXmNactivateCallback\fP and \fBXmNdisarmCallback\fP callbacks are
called.
.br
.ne 5
.IP "\fBBtnDown()\fP:"
This action unposts any menus posted by the PushButton's parent menu,

for the nearest ancestor that has them.
.IP "\fBMenuShellPopdownOne()\fP:"
