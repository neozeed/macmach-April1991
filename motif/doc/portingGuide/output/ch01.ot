       This document provides information for porting Applications
       to OSF/Motif.  It is of particular interest to developers
       porting applications from the XUI toolkit.

       In certain areas the OSF/Motif toolkit is different from the
       XUI toolkit.  In some instances, the functionality present
       in XUI has been changed; in other instances the functional-
       ity found in XUI is not present in OSF/Motif.  The purpose
       of this chapter (and of Appendix A) is to help developers
       with significant applications on XUI to move those applica-
       tions, as painlessly as possible, to the OSF/Motif toolkit.

       Developers should be aware that the changes outlined in this
       document are merely a starting point and are by no means
       complete.  This is particularly true of the section entitled
       "Widget Hierarchy Differences by Class" later in this
       chapter.  A complete version of this document will be avail-
       able with Motif Release 1.0.

       The OSF/Motif toolkit provides some functionality that goes
       beyond what is present in XUI.  However, since this func-
       tionality does not conflict with the XUI API, it is not
       documented here.

       This remainder of this document describes, in general, the
       changes that were made to XUI in order to produce the
       OSF/Motif toolkit.  The bulk of these changes were made to
       incorporate Presentation Manager (PM) behavior and the 3D
       beveled appearance.  Other changes were made to provide con-
       sistent naming or to prepare for enhanced functionality.

       XUI defined a DwtCommon class which was a superclass not
       only for primitive widgets such as DwtLabel and
       DwtScrollBar, but also for composite widgets such as DwtMenu
       and DwtMainWindow.  It defined a number of generally useful
       resources.  These resources were also repeated in the DwtDi-
       alog widget, and some of them in the DwtSText widget, nei-
       ther of which were subclasses of DwtCommon.  Figure 1 on the
       following page outlines the XUI widget hierarchy.

       Motif defines XmManager as the superclass for all Motif com-
       posite widgets, including both XmMainWindow (which was in
       XUI's DwtCommon) and XmBulletinBoard (equivalent to DwtDia-
       log, which was not).  XmPrimitive is the superclass all for
       primitive widgets, including both XmScrollBar (which was in
       XUI's DwtCommon), and XmText (equivalent to DwtSText, which
       was not).  The reorganization of the class hierarchy based
       on XmManager and XmPrimitive (as well as XmGadget, the
       superclass for gadgets) was primarily done to simplify cod-
       ing of PM-style keyboard traversal.  Figure 2 outlines the
       OSF/Motif widget hierarchy.

       Motif uses consistent visuals for all widgets that support a
       "3D bevelled" appearance.  The resources which control these
       are found in XmManager, XmPrimitive, and XmGadget, and
       include:

       - XmNbottomShadowColor
       - XmNbottomShadowPixmap
       - XmNshadowThickness
       - XmNtopShadowColor
       - XmNtopShadowPixmap

       These replace some resources used in XUI which had specific
       visual effects, in particular:

       - DwtNhalfBorder in DwtSText.
       - DwtNbordHighlight, DwtNfillHighlight, and DwtNshadown in DwtPushButton

       XUI provided a resolution independence mechanism which
       allowed the x,y position of children in dialog boxes (DwtDi-
       alog or its subclasses) to be specified in either pixel
       units or font units, based upon a DwtNunits resource in the
       dialog box.

       Motif provides a resolution independence mechanism (not in
       the AES, however) for all widgets.  Each widget (or gadget)
       has an XmNunitType resource, the value of which can be
       XmPIXELS, Xm100TH_MILLIMETERS, Xm1000TH_INCHES,
       Xm100TH_POINTS, or Xm100TH_FONT_UNITS.  The unitType of a
       widget determines the unit used for evaluating its own width
       and height, and its own (not its children's) x,y position.

       XUI uses a "Globally Active" input model.  When a user
       clicks on a widget, that widget determines whether or not
       the window should take the keyboard focus.  In particular,
       scrollbars in XUI do not take focus.

       Motif uses a "Passive" input model.  When a user clicks any-
       where within a window, the window manager determines whether
       or not that window should have the focus.  In particular,
       the Motif Window Manager, when operating using an explicit
       keyboardFocusPolicy, sets focus to the window depending upon
       which button has been pressed.

       Consequently, Motif widget developers should not explicitly
       call XSetInputFocus.

       In XUI, both DwtSText and DwtListBox had scrolling built-in.
       DwtListBox always provided vertical scrollbars if necessary,
       and optionally provided horizontal scrollbars based upon
       DwtNHorizontal.  DwtSText optionally provided a vertical
       scrollbar based on DwtNscrollVertical, with DwtNscrollLeft-
       Side determining if the scrollbar should be placed to the
       left or right of the text.

       In Motif, scrollbars are provided by placing either an
       XmText or XmList widget inside of an XmScrolledWindow
       widget, which actually provides the scrollbars.  Scrollbars
       can be placed vertically on either the left or right, and
       horizontally on either the top or bottom.

       The convenience function XmCreateScrolledList creates an
       XmList inside an XmScrolledWindow, and attaches XmList-
       specific callbacks to the scrollbars.  The argument list
       provided with XmCreateScrolledList is passed to the XmList
       widget, which interprets some of its arguments to control
       the scrollbars, including XmNlistSizePolicy, XmNscrollBar-
       DisplayPolicy, and XmNscrollBarPlacement.  Depending upon
       the policies chosen, both horizontal and vertical scrollbars
       will either always be displayed, or just displayed when
       needed.

       The convenience function XmCreateScrolledText creates an
       XmText inside an XmScrolledWindow, and attaches XmText-
       specific callbacks to the scrollbars.  The argument list
       provided with XmCreateScrolledText is passed to the XmText
       widget, which interprets some of its arguments to control
       the scrollbars.  XmNscrollHorizontal and XmNscrollVertical
       specify whether or not to provide horizontal or vertical
       scrollbars, and XmNscrollLeftSide and XmNscrollTopSide
       specify their placement.

       The compound string functionality supported in XUI has been
       altered in Motif to present a more vendor neutral naming
       scheme, as well as expanded application functionality.
       Most of the changes are simply name changes.   In the case
       of certain functions, argument order may have changed, or
       arguments may be missing. Appendix A lists the name changes,
       as well as suggested replacements for particular functions.

       In both XUI and Motif, gadgets (windowless widgets) increase
       performance by minimizing time for startup, exposure, and
       resize processing, and by eliminating server space for a
       window.   Both Motif and XUI subclass gadgets from RectObj,
       not from Core, so that gadgets are smaller than their
       corresponding widgets.  The missing Core resources deal with
       translations and accelerators, and with color and other
       aspects of the display, i.e.  XtNbackground, XtNbackground-
       Pixmap, XtNborderColor, XtNborderPixmap, XtNcolormap,
       XtNdepth, and XtNscreen.  These color-specific resources are
       taken from the gadget's parents.  That is, all of the gadget
       children of a manager widget share the same color-related
       resources.

       In both XUI and Motif, widgets also contain resources which
       control highlighting--XUI defines DwtNhighlight and
       DwtNhighlightPixmap in DwtCommon and DwtDialog, Motif
       defines XmNhighlightColor and XmNhighlightPixmap in XmPrimi-
       tive and XmManager.  Gadgets do not contain these resources.
       In both toolkits, the highlighting of a gadget is determined
       by the resources of its manager parent.

       Motif expands on this model of resource sharing with the
       other color-specific resources it defines--
       XmNbottomShadowColor, XmNbottomShadowPixmap, XmNtopSha-
       dowColor and XmNtopShadowPixmap.  These are defined in
       XmPrimitive and XmManager, but not in XmGadget.  Gadgets in
       Motif do not have these resources, and they are taken
       instead from the manager widget which is the gadget's
       parent.

       XUI takes a more aggressive approach to reducing gadget
       size.  In XUI, gadgets have many fewer resources than the
       corresponding widgets.  In gadgets, the default value of the
       missing resources are assumed, and cannot be changed.  Widg-
       ets must be used in those cases where a different value is
       required.

       The OSF UEC Selection Team did not choose to adopt the XUI
       DwtHelp widget as part of Motif.  DwtHelp uses file-based
       technology to provide a text-only help network.  The UEC
       Selection Team chose to defer this component until the
       industry could provide a hypermedia-based help system that
       could support graphics as well as text.

       Help callbacks are now provided as part of every widget and
       gadget in Motif, and applications can build their own help
       dialogs using XmCreateBuletinBoardDialog or XmCreateFormDia-
       log.

       Both XUI and Motif place top-level widgets in Shell widgets.
       Users generally do not instantiate these shell widgets
       directly.  Rather, they are instantiated as part of the
       functions which create their children.  For example,
       XmCreatePopupMenu creates an XmRowColumn widget inside an
       XmMenuShell, XmCreateFormDialog creates an XmForm widget
       inside an XmDialogShell, and XmCreateMainWindow creates an
       XmMainWindow widget inside an ApplicationShell.

       To speed up menu processing, all pulldown menu children of a
       menu bar share the same XmMenuShell widget.

       This section lists general rules for changing XUI widget,
       function, resource and other names to comply with OSF/Motif.
       Exceptions to each rule appear in Appendix A.

       Many of these changes are simply intended to create a vendor
       neutral naming scheme. For example, OSF/Motif uses the "Xm"
       (X Motif) prefix instead of the "Dwt" prefix used in XUI and
       the "Xaw" prefix used in the Athena Widget Set.

       Certain changes to enumeration literals are intended to
       reflect more closely the naming conventions set out in the
       Xt Intrinsics manual.  For example, enumeration literals are
       all upper case in the Intrinsics, and (except for the Xm
       prefix), the same convention has been followed in Motif.
       For example, the literal DwtAttachNone used for constraint
       resources in DwtAttachedDB widgets has been changed to
       XmATTACH_NONE.  Callback reasons have been similarly
       changed, for example, from DwtCRArm to XmCR_ARM.

       The general rules for name changes are as follows:

         1.  Change the prefix Dwt to Xm.
             For resource manager function names, change the prefix
             DwtDrm to Mrm.
             For resource names, change the prefix DwtN to XmN and
             the prefix DwtNadb to XmN.
         2.  Make the changes to widget class names specified in
             "Widget Hierarchy Differences by Class" later in this
             document.

         3.  Change all create function names from Dwt*Create to
             XmCreate*, while also keeping in mind the changes to
             widget class names.

         4.  The XUI create functions that do not use arglists
             (e.g., DwtLabel) have no counterpart in OSF/Motif.

         5.  Change the enumeration literals of the form
             DwtAaaaAaaa to the form XmAAAA_AAAA.

         6.  Change callback reasons from DwtCRAaaaAaaa to
             XmCR_AAAA_AAAA.

         7.  All String functions begin with XmString.
             All FontList functions begin with XmFontList.
             All Clipboard functions begin with XmClipboard.
             All resource manager (Mrm) functions begin with Mrm.
