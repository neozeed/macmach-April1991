       The manual pages in this volume use the following format:

            Purpose
                 This section gives a short description of the
                 interface.

            Synopsis
                 This section describes the appropriate syntax for
                 using the interface.

            Description
                 This section describes the behavior of the inter-
                 face.  On widget manual pages there are tables of
                 resource values in the descriptions.  Those tables
                 have the following headers:

                 Name      Contains the name of the resource.  Each
                           new resource is described following the
                           new resources table.

                 Class     Contains the class of the resource.

                 Type      Contains the type of the resource.

                 Default   Contains the default value of the
                           resource.

                 Access    Contains the access permissions for the
                           resource.  A CCCC in this column means the
                           resource can be set at widget creation
                           time.  An SSSS means the resource can be
                           set anytime.  A GGGG means the resource's
                           value can retrieved.

            Examples
                 This sections gives practical examples for using
                 the interface.

            Return Value
                 This lists the values returned by function inter-
                 faces.

            Errors
                 This section describes the error conditions asso-
                 ciated with using this interface.

            Related Information
                 This section provides cross-references to related
                 interfaces and header files described within this
                 document.
