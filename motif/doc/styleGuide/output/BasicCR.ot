       Basic controls are components that only take simple input.
       They are distinct from field controls in that they are usu-
       ally elements of navigation fields rather than fields them-
       selves.  Basic controls must have no internal navigation.
       The following text describes the basic controls.

                        between Menu items, and between Panes of a
                        PanedWindow.  A Separator allows no appli-
                        cation interaction.

                        PushButton contains a label that indicates
                        the operation of the button.  The label can
                        contain text or an image.

                        A CascadeButton contains a label that indi-
                        cates the Menu displayed.  CascadeButtons
                        can also contain an arrow graphic after the
                        label to distinguish it from PushButtons
                        and to indicate the direction of the cas-
                        cading Menu.

                        An Option Menu allows for a one of many
                        selection.  An OptionButton contains a
                        label that indicates the current state of
                        the Option Menu, and a bar graphic to dis-
                        tinguish it from a PushButton.

                        ToggleButton contains a label that indi-
                        cates the state of the ToggleButton when it
                        is set.  Normally, preceding the label is a
                        graphic indicator of the state of the Tog-
                        gleButton.

                        where any number of the ToggleButtons can
                        be on at a time.  The graphic indicator for
                        a CheckButton is usually a raised square to
                        indicate the on state or a pressed square
                        to indicate the off state.

                        where only one of the ToggleButtons can be















                        on at a time.  The graphic indicator for a
                        RadioButton is usually a filled diamond or
                        circle to indicate the on state or an empty
                        diamond or circle to indicate the off
                        state.

       A single line Text control can be configured to act like a
       basic control.  Basic controls must have no internal naviga-
       tion.  Activatable basic controls follow the basic activa-
       tion model described in Section 3.3.1.  For more informa-
       tion, see the reference pages for each basic control.
