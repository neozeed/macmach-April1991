       An IconBox is a specialized window that acts as a storage
       location for icons.  The illustration on this reference page
       shows a typical IconBox.

       The window manager must allow the IconBox to have all the
       same components as any other primary window.  Like other
       windows, it can be sized, moved, minimized, maximized,
       restored, and lowered.  However, the window manager must not
       allow the IconBox to be closed.  The system Menu action
       CCCClllloooosssseeee must be replaced with the system Menu action PPPPaaaacccckkkk
       IIIIccccoooonnnnssss in an IconBox.  PPPPaaaacccckkkk IIIIccccoooonnnnssss arranges the icons as close
       as possible together in the visible icon area.  PPPPaaaacccckkkk IIIIccccoooonnnnssss
       must have the mnemonic PPPP.  If PPPPaaaacccckkkk IIIIccccoooonnnnssss has an accelerator,
       it must be MMMMAAAAlllltttt <<<<FFFF11112222>>>> if <<<<FFFF11112222>>>> is available.

       The IconBox can contain an icon for each window family, even
       if it is active.  The icon for minimized window families
       must be the same as the icon would be outside of the Icon-
       Box.  The icon for an active window family should be similar
       to the minimized icon, deemphasized somehow, and without the
       icon image border.

       Clicking BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt in an icon must give the icon keyboard
       focus and can post the icon Menu.  The icon Menu must be the
       same Menu as the window Menu for the associated primary win-
       dow.  If the icon represents an active window family,
       RRRReeeessssttttoooorrrreeee, SSSSiiiizzzzeeee, MMMMiiiinnnniiiimmmmiiiizzzzeeee, and MMMMaaaaxxxxiiiimmmmiiiizzzzeeee must not be available
       from the icon Menu.  If the icon represents a minimized win-
       dow family, SSSSiiiizzzzeeee and MMMMiiiinnnniiiimmmmiiiizzzzeeee must not be available from the
       icon Menu.

       Double-clicking BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt anywhere in an icon that represents
       a minimized window family must restore the window family,
       just as the icon Menu item RRRReeeessssttttoooorrrreeee.  Double-clicking BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt
       anywhere in an icon that represents an active window family
       must raise the window family to the top of the window
       hierarchy.  Pressing BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt or BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg anywhere in the icon
       and dragging the mouse pointer must move the icon within the
       icon area to track the pointer, just as the icon Menu item
       MMMMoooovvvveeee does.
