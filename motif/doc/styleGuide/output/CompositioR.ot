       The Composition group should be used to organize components
       in an arbitrary layout.  The layout style can be either
       arbitrary, in even rows and columns, or so that the position
       of components is relative to the Composition component and
       the components it contains.  This component is composed of
       an area for organizing components.  This group must follow
       the navigation model as described in Chapter 2.  For more
       information, see the reference pages for each layout group.
