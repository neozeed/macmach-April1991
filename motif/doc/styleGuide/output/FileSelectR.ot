       A FileSelectionBox is a special purpose composite component
       for file selection.  It can be used to traverse through
       directories, view the files and subdirectories in them, and
       then select files.  The FileSelectionBox must be composed of
       the following elements:

          +o A Text component for displaying and editing a directory
            mask used to select the files to be displayed.  The
            directory mask must be a string specifying the base
            directory to be examined and a search pattern.

          +o A List component for displaying file names.  The file
            list should display all files and subdirectories in the
            base directory that match the search pattern.

          +o A List component for displaying subdirectories.  The
            directory list should display the subdirectories of the
            base directory, as well as the base directory itself
            and its parent directory.

          +o A Text component for displaying and editing a filename.

          +o A group of PushButtons, labeled OOOOKKKK, FFFFiiiilllltttteeeerrrr, CCCCaaaannnncccceeeellll, and
            HHHHeeeellllpppp

       The user must be able to select a new directory to examine
       by scrolling through the list of directories and selecting
       the desired directory or by editing the directory mask.
       Selecting a new directory from the directory list must not
       change the search pattern.  A user must be able to select a
       new search pattern by editing the directory mask.  Double
       clicking BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt or pressing KKKKAAAAccccttttiiiivvvvaaaatttteeee on a directory in the
       directory list must initiate a search for files and sub-
       directories in the new directory, using the current search
       pattern.

       The user must be able to select a file by scrolling through
       the list of filenames and selecting the desired file or by
       entering the filename directly into the Text component.
       Selecting a file from the list causes that filename to
       appear in the file selection Text component.

       The user may select a new file as many times as desired.
       The application must not be notified until one of the fol-
       lowing events occur:

          +o The OOOOKKKK PushButton is activated.

          +o KKKKAAAAccccttttiiiivvvvaaaatttteeee is pressed while the Text component has the
            keyboard focus.















          +o KKKKAAAAccccttttiiiivvvvaaaatttteeee is pressed while the location cursor is on an
            item in the file list.

          +o BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt is double clicked on an item in the file list.

       The FileSelectionBox must initiate a directory and file
       search when any of the following occurs:

          +o The FileSelectionBox is initialized

          +o The contents of the directory mask is changed

          +o The user activates the FFFFiiiilllltttteeeerrrr PushButton

          +o The user double clicks or presses KKKKAAAAccccttttiiiivvvvaaaatttteeee on an item
            in the directory list

          +o The user presses KKKKAAAAccccttttiiiivvvvaaaatttteeee while the directory mask
            text edit area has the keyboard focus
