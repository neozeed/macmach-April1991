       A MenuBar should be used to organize the most common
       features of an application.  The MenuBar must be a horizon-
       tal bar at the top edge of the application just below the
       title area of the window frame.  The MenuBar contains a list
       of Menu topics in CascadeButtons with PullDown Menus con-
       nected to them.  Commands must not be included as topics in
       the MenuBar because they inhibit Menu browsing.  Each Menu
       topic should have a single letter mnemonic indicated by an
       underline.

       The following Menus pulled down from the MenuBar provide
       general functions common to most applications.

       FFFFiiiilllleeee      The FFFFiiiilllleeee Menu should contain components for per-
                 forming actions on the files, such as opening,
                 saving, closing, and printing.  It should also
                 contain components for performing actions on the
                 application as a whole, such as quitting.  If your
                 application includes a FFFFiiiilllleeee Menu, it must be the
                 first entry in the MenuBar, and placed to the far
                 left.  The FFFFiiiilllleeee Menu should have a mnemonic of FFFF.

       EEEEddddiiiitttt      The EEEEddddiiiitttt Menu should contain components for per-
                 forming actions on the current data of the appli-
                 cation, such as an undo action or making global
                 changes to text.  It should also include com-
                 ponents for interacting with the system clipboard,
                 such as cut, copy, and paste.  If your application
                 includes an EEEEddddiiiitttt Menu, it must be placed to the
                 right of the FFFFiiiilllleeee Menu.  The EEEEddddiiiitttt Menu should have
                 a mnemonic of EEEE.

       VVVViiiieeeewwww      The VVVViiiieeeewwww Menu should contain components for chang-
                 ing the users view on the data.  Components in the
                 VVVViiiieeeewwww Menu should not actually change the data.
                 The exact contents of the VVVViiiieeeewwww Menu are applica-
                 tion specific, but it may include components that
                 change the appearance of the data, the amount of
                 data that is displayed, or the order in which the
                 data is displayed.  If your application includes a
                 VVVViiiieeeewwww Menu, it must be placed to the right of the
                 EEEEddddiiiitttt Menu.  The VVVViiiieeeewwww Menu should have a mnemonic
                 of VVVV.

       OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss   The OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss Menu should contain components for a
                 user to customize the application.  The exact con-
                 tents of the OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss Menu are application
                 specific.  If your application includes an OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss
                 Menu, it must be placed to the right of the VVVViiiieeeewwww
                 Menu.  The OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss Menu should have a mnemonic of















                 OOOO.

       HHHHeeeellllpppp      The HHHHeeeellllpppp Menu should contain components that pro-
                 vide user help facilities.  The components in the
                 HHHHeeeellllpppp Menu usually bring up a DialogBox with help
                 information.  Every application should have a HHHHeeeellllpppp
                 Menu.  If your application includes a HHHHeeeellllpppp Menu,
                 it must be the last Menu item, and placed to the
                 far right on the MenuBar.  The HHHHeeeellllpppp Menu should
                 have a mnemonic of HHHH.

       While we recommended that you include the common Menus in
       the MenuBar of your application, your choice of Menu titles
       and items depends on the nature of your application.  If
       your application requires it, you should design more
       relevant titles and selections, but do not change the mean-
       ings of words used in the common Menus.

       The recommended contents of the FFFFiiiilllleeee, EEEEddddiiiitttt, and HHHHeeeellllpppp Menus
       are described on their own reference pages.  The contents of
       the VVVViiiieeeewwww and OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss Menus are application specific and are
       not specified here.








       The MenuBar follows the navigation model described in
       Chapter 2.  The following text describes the operations of
       this component.

       KKKKHHHHeeeellllpppp:    Must provide any available help for the current
                 CascadeButton.
