       This chapter presents detailed information about components,
       user interface models, and concepts in reference format.
       Each topic starts on a new page and is organized alphabeti-
       cally.  Details on user interface models and concepts are
       provided in the earlier chapters of this _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e.  The
       model and concepts reference pages are provided here only as
       a quick reference to information provided earlier, and are
       not complete in every detail.  Therefore, they should not be
       used as the definitive source for information about user
       interface models and concepts.  This chapter includes the
       following model and concepts reference pages.

       Accelerators        File Menu        Layout Groups
       Activation          Focus            Mnemonics
       Basic Controls      Framing Groups   Navigation
       Basic Groups        Help Menu        Pointer Shapes
       DefaultActivation   Icon Menu        Primary Selection
       Drag and Drop       IconBox          Quick Transfer
       Edit Menu           Icons            Selection
       Field Controls      Input Devices    Window Menu

       The reference pages for components are provided for
       designers to use when implementing the components described
       in this guide or when creating new components.  Remember
       when designing new components, you should follow the same
       rules that application designers follow.  As such, you
       should be familiar with all the chapters of this _S_t_y_l_e
       _G_u_i_d_e, not just this reference-page section.  New components
       must follow the guidelines for designing applications.  This
       chapter contains the following control and group reference
       pages.

       Canvas                Label            RadioButton
       CascadeButton         List             Sash
       CheckButton           MainWindow       Scale
       CommandBox            MenuBar          ScrollBar
       CommandDialog         Menus            ScrolledWindow
       Composition           MessageDialog    SelectionBox






                                                                7-1












       DialogBox             OptionButton     SelectionDialog
       ErrorDialog           PanedWindow      Separator
       FileSelectionBox      Panel            Text
       FileSelectionDialog   PromptDialog     ToggleButton
       Frame                 PushButton       WarningDialog
       InformationDialog     QuestionDialog   WorkingDialogBox

       When designing a new component, compare its features with
       those of other components.  If the new component has a
       feature that is the same as another component, the mechan-
       isms for using the feature, layout, key bindings, graphics,
       and so on, must be similar to the existing component.

       Each component reference page contains the following infor-
       mation about the component.

                         The illustrations in this _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e use
                         the OSF/Motif reference appearance with
                         3-dimensional beveled edges.  Although it
                         is important to be consistent in the
                         placement of the elements in a component,
                         the appearance, or rendering, of the com-
