       Field controls are components that use internal navigation
       controls.  Field controls should be navigation fields.  The
       following text describes the field controls.

       SSSSaaaasssshhhh             Used to set the boundary between two com-
                        ponents.  A Sash is usually a small square
                        on the boundary between two components.
                        The separated components are called Panes,
                        and a group of Panes, Separators, and
                        Sashes is called a PanedWindow.

       SSSSccccaaaalllleeee            Used to set or display a value in a range.
                        A Scale is usually composed of a slider,
                        moving within an element that indicates the
                        size of the range, and a label that indi-
                        cates the current value.  The position of
                        the slider indicates the value relative to
                        the range.  The slider is moved directly by
                        using the mouse pointer, or by using the
                        arrow keys.  A Scale can also have buttons
                        with arrow graphics for moving the slider
                        with the mouse.

       SSSSccccrrrroooollllllllBBBBaaaarrrr        Used to scroll the visible area of a com-
                        ponent.  A ScrollBar is usually composed of
                        a slider, moving within an element that
                        indicates the full size of the component,
                        and buttons with arrow graphics for moving
                        the slider with the mouse.  The slider
                        indicates the relative position and size of
                        the visible area of the component.  The
                        slider is moved directly by using the mouse
                        pointer, or by using the arrow keys.

       LLLLiiiisssstttt             Used for selecting elements from a list of
                        elements.  A List can allow multiple items
                        to be selected or can be constrained to
                        only allow one item to be selected at a
                        time.  A List is usually composed of a
                        vertical list of items.  A List can also
                        have both horizontal and vertical
                        ScrollBars for scrolling the visible por-
                        tion of the list of items.

       TTTTeeeexxxxtttt             Used for displaying, entering, and modify-
                        ing text.  There are single line and multi-
                        ple line variants.  Multiline Text can have
                        both horizontal and vertical ScrollBars for
                        scrolling the visible portion of the text
                        area.

                        ing graphics.  A Canvas can have both hor-
                        izontal and vertical ScrollBars for scrol-
                        ling the visible portion of the drawing
                        area.
       Field controls have navigation that is specific to the com-
       ponent.  See the reference page for each field control for
       information about its navigation.  Field controls have
       operations that are specific to the component.  See the
       reference page for each field control for information about
       its operations.  For more information, see the reference
       pages for each field control.
