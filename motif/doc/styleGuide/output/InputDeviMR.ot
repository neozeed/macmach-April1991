       The most typical pointing device is a mouse, although a
       graphics tablet, track ball, joystick, and other tools also
       work as pointing devices.  You can use any pointing device
       in place of a mouse.  This guide assumes that a mouse, or
       any pointing device, has the following three buttons.
       Chapter 2 describes the button bindings for pointing devices
       that do not have three buttons.

       BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt   Used for selection, activation, and setting the
                 location cursor.  This button must be the leftmost
                 mouse button, except for left-handed users where
                 it can be the rightmost button.

       BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg     Used for moving and copying elements.  This button
                 must be the middle mouse button.

       BBBBCCCCuuuussssttttoooommmm   Used for additional user interactions, including
                 popping up Menus and special dialogs, and for
                 application-specific interactions.  This button
                 must be the rightmost mouse button, except for
                 left-handed users where it can be the leftmost
                 button.  This guide also mentions the button
                 BBBBMMMMeeeennnnuuuu, which must be bound to BBBBCCCCuuuussssttttoooommmm.  BBBBMMMMeeeennnnuuuu is
                 used for popping up Menus.

       Because not all keyboards are the same, it is difficult to
       give style guidelines that are correct for every
       manufacturer's keyboard.  To solve this problem, this guide
       describes keys using a virtual mechanism; that is, by the
       action they perform.  Everywhere that keyboard input is
       specified, the keys are indicated by their virtual key name.

       The virtual key mechanism includes keys, modifiers, and
       mouse buttons.  The mouse button virtual keys are described
       earlier in this reference page as BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt, BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg, BBBBCCCCuuuussssttttoooommmm,
       and BBBBMMMMeeeennnnuuuu.  Note that all button virtual keys start with the
       letter BBBB.  All normal key virtual keys start with the letter
       KKKK.  All modifier key virtual keys start with the letter MMMM.

       This guide assumes that a keyboard has all the standard
       alphabetic, numeric, and symbol keys, as well as the special
       keys <<<<RRRReeeettttuuuurrrrnnnn>>>>, <<<<TTTTaaaabbbb>>>>, <<<<EEEEssssccccaaaappppeeee>>>>, <<<<DDDDeeeelllleeeetttteeee>>>>, <<<<SSSSppppaaaacccceeeebbbbaaaarrrr>>>>, and
       <<<<BBBBaaaacccckkkkssssppppaaaacccceeee>>>>.  This _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e describes the common bindings
       of some actions in terms of the function keys <<<<FFFF1111>>>> through
       <<<<FFFF11110000>>>>.  These are nominal bindings and can be changed if the
       function keys are not available, or if another binding is
       preferred.  It also assumes that the arrow keys are avail-
       able.  Additional keys, including navigation keys and spe-
       cial keys like <<<<MMMMeeeennnnuuuu>>>> and <<<<HHHHeeeellllpppp>>>>, are suggested, but not
       necessary for full keyboard equivalence.















       This guide also assumes that all keyboards have the three
       modifier keys MMMMSSSShhhhiiiifffftttt, MMMMCCCCttttrrrrllll, and MMMMAAAAlllltttt, which are usually
       bound to <<<<SSSShhhhiiiifffftttt>>>>, <<<<CCCCttttrrrrllll>>>>, and <<<<AAAAlllltttt>>>> or <<<<MMMMeeeettttaaaa>>>>.  Your key-
       board may have the virtual buttons, keys, or modifiers bound
       as appropriate. Appendix A lists all of the virtual keys
       used in this guide, as well as suggested and alternative
       bindings.  See Chapter 2 for a more information about input
       devices.  See Appendix A for a listing of virtual keys and
       their common bindings.
