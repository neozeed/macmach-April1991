       Framing groups are used to frame groups of components as the
       following text describes.

                        A MainWindow frames the client area and can
                        optionally include ScrollBars, a MenuBar, a
                        command area, and a message area.
       These groups must follow the navigation model as described
       in Chapter 2.  For more information, see the reference pages
       for each framing group.
