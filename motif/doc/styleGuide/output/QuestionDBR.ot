       A QuestionDialog should be used to get a user response to a
       question.  It should interrupt the user's interaction with
       the application.  It should include a question symbol, a
       message, and one of the following button arrangements.

       YYYYeeeessss NNNNoooo
       YYYYeeeessss NNNNoooo HHHHeeeellllpppp

       It is possible that both the YYYYeeeessss and NNNNoooo actions of a Ques-
       tion DialogBox will perform an action.  If this is the case
       the Question DialogBox should use one of the following but-
       ton arrangements:

       YYYYeeeessss NNNNoooo CCCCaaaannnncccceeeellll
       YYYYeeeessss NNNNoooo CCCCaaaannnncccceeeellll HHHHeeeellllpppp
