       The _O_S_F/_M_o_t_i_f _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e provides a framework of behavior
       specifications to guide application developers, widget
       developers, user interface system developers, and window
       manager developers in the design and implementation of new
       products consistent with the OSF/MotifTM user interface.
       This _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e is also closely consistent with Microsoft
       Windows, Presentation Manager, and Common User Access (CUA).

       The _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e establishes a consistent behavior among new
       products by drawing out the common elements from a variety
       of current behavioral models.  The _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e anticipates
       the evolution of graphical user interfaces as new technology
       becomes available and as the use of the MotifTM user inter-
       face spreads.  Behavioral guidelines will be added over time
       as they become stable.

       For specific details of coding the implementation into an
       application program, widget, or window manager see the other
       volumes of the OSF/Motif documentation set.

       The Motif document set uses the following typographic con-
       ventions:

          +o BBBBoooollllddddffffaaaacccceeeedddd strings represent key and button bindings,
            and literal values.  BBBBoooollllddddffffaaaacccceeeedddd strings also represent
            the first use of words described in the glossary .

          +o <<<<KKKKeeeeyyyy>>>> represents a key on the keyboard.  The word in
            italics corresponds to the engraving on the actual key.

          +o Components of the user interface are represented by
            capital letters on each major word in the name of the
            component, such as PushButton.

       See "Compliance Conventions" below for an explanation of the
       asterisks (*) that appear in the margins.

       Since not all keyboards are the same, it is difficult to
       give style guidelines that are correct for every
       manufacturer's keyboard.  To solve this problem, this guide
       describes keys and buttons using a vvvviiiirrrrttttuuuuaaaallll bbbbiiiinnnnddddiiiinnnngggg mechan-
       ism, by the action they perform.  Everywhere that keyboard
       input is specified, the keys are indicated by their virtual
       key name.  This guide separately explains which actual keys
       are commonly used for each virtual key.  For instance, the
       virtual key KKKKAAAAccccttttiiiivvvvaaaatttteeee is used for keyboard activation of
       components and is commonly bound to <<<<RRRReeeettttuuuurrrrnnnn>>>> and MMMMCCCCttttrrrrllll
       <<<<RRRReeeettttuuuurrrrnnnn>>>>, or <<<<EEEEnnnntttteeeerrrr>>>> and/or MMMMCCCCttttrrrrllll <<<<EEEEnnnntttteeeerrrr>>>> depending on the
       keyboard.  This mechanism also simplifies the descriptions
       of behavior where multiple keys can be bound simultaneously
       to one virtual key.

       The virtual key mechanism includes keys, modifiers, and
       mouse buttons.  Virtual mouse buttons start with the letter
       BBBB.  For a three button mouse, the leftmost mouse button is
       usually defined as BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt, the middle mouse button is usu-
       ally defined as BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg, and the rightmost mouse button is
       usually defined as BBBBCCCCuuuussssttttoooommmm.  Details about how virtual mouse
       buttons are usually defined are described in Section 2.2,
       and where a new virtual button is described for the first
       time.

       All normal virtual keys start with the letter KKKK.  All modif-
       ier virtual keys start with the letter MMMM.

       This guide assumes that a keyboard has all the standard
       alphabetic, numeric, and symbol keys, as well as the special
       keys corresponding to the actions Enter, usually <<<<RRRReeeettttuuuurrrrnnnn>>>> or
       <<<<EEEEnnnntttteeeerrrr>>>> Tab, Spacebar, Backspace, Delete, Escape, Insert, |^,

       |v, <-, ->, Begin Line, usually <<<<BBBBeeeeggggiiiinnnn>>>> or <<<<HHHHoooommmmeeee>>>>, End Line,
       usually <<<<EEEEnnnndddd>>>>, Page Up, and Page Down.  Each of this keys     *
       must be available either as specified or using other keys or  *
       key combinations if the specified key is unavailable.

       This guide also requires the nominal keys corresponding to
       the actions Move to the MenuBar (<<<<FFFF11110000>>>>), pop up a menu
       (<<<<MMMMeeeennnnuuuu>>>> or <<<<FFFF4444>>>>), provide help (<<<<HHHHeeeellllpppp>>>> or <<<<FFFF1111>>>>), toggle add
       mode (<<<<SSSShhhhiiiifffftttt>>>> <<<<FFFF8888>>>>), and move to the next pane (<<<<FFFF6666>>>>).  Each  *
       of this keys must be available either as specified or using   *
       other keys or key combinations if the specified key is una-   *
       vailable.  If the chosen binding involves a function key,     *
       the one listed above must be used, unless it is not avail-    *
       able on the keyboard.  Additional keys, including navigation
       keys and special keys like <<<<MMMMeeeennnnuuuu>>>> and <<<<HHHHeeeellllpppp>>>>, are suggested,
       but not necessary for full keyboard equivalence.

       This guide also assumes that all keyboards have the three
       modifier keys MMMMSSSShhhhiiiifffftttt, MMMMCCCCttttrrrrllll, and MMMMAAAAlllltttt, which are usually
       bound to <<<<SSSShhhhiiiifffftttt>>>>, <<<<CCCCttttrrrrllll>>>>, and <<<<AAAAlllltttt>>>>.  Your keyboard may have
       the virtual buttons, keys, or modifiers bound as appropri-
       ate. Appendix A lists all of the virtual bindings used in
       this guide, as well as suggested and alternative bindings.
       To avoid confusion, this guide also mentions the suggested
       bindings of virtual keys throughout.

       Throughout the _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e "must," "should," and "can" have
       special meanings.  Guidelines with "must" in them are
       requirements for _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e compliance.  Any guideline with
       "must" will be included in the _O_S_F/_M_o_t_i_f _L_e_v_e_l _1 _C_e_r_t_i_f_i_c_a_-
       _t_i_o_n _C_h_e_c_k_l_i_s_t for _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e compliance.  Any guideline
       with "must" will be marked in the margin with an asterisk.
       Guidelines with "should" in them are recommendations.  We
       consider them important for interapplication consistency,
       but we do not want to require them for compliance.  You
       should follow them as closely as you are able.  Guidelines
       with "can" in them indicate optional elements of user inter-
       face style.

       The process for how _S_t_y_l_e _G_u_i_d_e elements migrate from
       options, to recommendations, to requirements is described in
       the _O_S_F/_M_o_t_i_f _L_e_v_e_l _1 _C_e_r_t_i_f_i_c_a_t_i_o_n _C_h_e_c_k_l_i_s_t.

       Note that by default this guide assumes your application is
       being designed for a left-to-right language direction
       environment, and that the application is written in English.
       Many of these guidelines can, and in fact should, be modi-
       fied based on both language and scanning direction.
