       A SelectionBox is a special purpose composite component for
       making selections from a list of choices.  The SelectionBox
       must be composed of a Text component for the selected alter-
       native, and a List component above the Text component for
       presenting the alternatives.  Both the List and Text com-
       ponents should have a Label above them.  The List component
       can be scrollable.  The SelectionBox should also include one
       of the following button arrangements.

       The List must use either the single or browse selection
       model.  Selecting an element from the list must place the
       selected element in the Text component.  Entering an item
       name into the Text component must make that element visible
       in the List component.
