       The common File Menu contents are described as follows.
       Note that you should only include those functions actually
       supported by your application.  The illustration on this
       reference page shows a File Menu.

       N____NNNeeeewwww       Must create a new file.  The NNNNeeeewwww operation must
                 clear existing data from the client area.  If com-
                 pletion of the operation will obliterate current
                 changes to the file, you must display a DialogBox,
                 asking the user about saving changes.  This action
                 must have the mnemonic NNNN.

       O____OOOppppeeeennnn .... .... .... Must open an existing file.  The OOOOppppeeeennnn operation
                 must prompt the user for the name of the file with
                 a DialogBox.  The title bar should be updated with
                 the name of the newly opened file.  If completion
                 of the operation will obliterate current changes
                 to the file, you must display a DialogBox, asking
                 the user about saving changes.  This DialogBox
                 should be displayed after the user selects a new
                 file.  This action must have the mnemonic OOOO.

       S____SSSaaaavvvveeee      Must save the currently opened file without remov-
                 ing the existing contents of the client area.  If
                 the currently opened file has no name, SSSSaaaavvvveeee must
                 prompt for a filename with a DialogBox.  This
                 action must have the mnemonic SSSS.

       SSSSaaaavvvveeee A____AAAssss .... .... .... Must save the currently opened file under a
                 new name without removing the existing contents of
                 the client area.  The SSSSaaaavvvveeee AAAAssss operation must
                 prompt for the name of the file with a DialogBox.
                 If the user tries to save the new file under an
                 existing name, SSSSaaaavvvveeee AAAAssss must alert the user with a
                 DialogBox of a possible loss of data.  This action
                 must have the mnemonic AAAA.

       P____PPPrrrriiiinnnntttt     Must schedule a file for printing.  If your appli-
                 cation requires specific printing information
                 before printing, the operation must first request
                 that information with a DialogBox, and the entry
                 title must be followed by an ellipses.  Printing
                 information can also be specified for the applica-
                 tion in the OOOOppppttttiiiioooonnnnssss Menu.  This action must have
                 the mnemonic PPPP.

       C____CCClllloooosssseeee     Can be supplied in applications that have multiple
                 independent primary windows.  This action must not
                 be supplied in applications with a single primary
                 window, or multiple dependent primary windows.















                 This action must only close the current primary
                 window and its associated secondary windows; that
                 is, the window family.  This action must have the
                 mnemonic CCCC.  You can include this action even
                 though it is similar to the CCCClllloooosssseeee action in the
                 window Menu.  This ensures that users have a way
                 to close the primary window even if they are not
                 running a compliant window manager.  Applications
                 should prompt the user to save any unsaved changes
                 if the action would cause loss of data.

       E____EEExxxxiiiitttt      Must end the current application and all windows
                 associated with it.  This action is equivalent to
                 closing all primary windows of the application. If
                 completion of the operation will obliterate
                 current changes to the file, you must display a
                 DialogBox, asking the user about saving changes.
                 This action must have the mnemonic EEEE.  You should
                 include this action even though it is similar to
                 the CCCClllloooosssseeee action in the window Menu.  This ensures
                 that users have a way to end the application even
                 if they are not running a compliant window
                 manager.  Applications should prompt the user to
                 save any unsaved changes if the action would cause
                 loss of data.  If your application does not have a
                 FFFFiiiilllleeee Menu, put EEEExxxxiiiitttt at the end of the first Pull-
                 Down Menu.
