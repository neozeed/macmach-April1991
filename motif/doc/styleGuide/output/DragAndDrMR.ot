       The drag-and-drop model allows the user to move or copy the
       selected elements by dragging them to a new location.  Even
       collections that do not support dragging of their own ele-
       ments can support drops of elements from other collections.

       If a component implements dragging, it should use BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg to
       perform the drag operations.  Some implementations may
       choose to use BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt instead of BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg.  When BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt is
       used for dragging operations, its use must supersede the use
       of BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt DDDDrrrraaaagggg in the selection models described in Section
       3.1.  Applications that implement the drag-and-drop model
       using BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt must also support the use of BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg instead.

       When using BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg for dragging elements, if BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg is pressed
       on a selected element or within a linear range of selected
       elements, it must drag the entire selection until it is
       released.  If BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg is pressed outside of the selected range
       in a text-like collection, it must do a quick transfer
       instead of dragging the element.  Quick transfer is
       described in Section 3.2.3.  If BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg is pressed on an
       unselected element in a list-like collection, it can either
       do a quick transfer or a dragging operation.  The behavior
       of BBBBDDDDrrrraaaagggg PPPPrrrreeeessssssss in a graphics-like collection is unspecified.
       It can either do a quick transfer, a dragging operation, or
       pan the visible region.

       The type of the elements dragged, and the source and desti-
       nation of the drag-and-drop operations determine whether the
       operation causes a move or a copy as follows:

          +o Dragging to a transport device, such as a printer or
            mailbox, must be treated as a copy.

          +o Dragging to a removal device, such as a wastebasket or
            shredder, must be treated as a move.

          +o Dragging to a non-Text container must be treated as a
            move.

          +o Dragging text to or from a Text component must be
            treated as a copy.

       Pressing MMMMCCCCttttrrrrllll with the drag operation must make the opera-
       tion a copy.  Pressing MMMMAAAAlllltttt with the drag operation must
       make the operation a move.  See Chapter 3 for more informa-
       tion on the drag-and-drop model, and for information on
       quick transfer and the selection models.
