       The selection model determines how elements are selected
       from a group of elements.  OSF/Motif compliant systems must
       support the five different selection models.  The five
       selection models are as follows:

       SSSSiiiinnnngggglllleeee SSSSeeeelllleeeeccccttttiiiioooonnnn         Used to select a single element in
                                a collection.  Clicking BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt on
                                an element selects it and deselects
                                the previously selected element in
                                the collection.  Single selection
                                is described in Section 3.1.1

       BBBBrrrroooowwwwsssseeee SSSSeeeelllleeeeccccttttiiiioooonnnn         Used to allow browsing through sin-
                                gle selection collections.  Browse
                                selection is also used to select a
                                single element of a collection.
                                Browse selection works just like
                                single selection, but additionally
                                allows the user to browse through
                                the elements by dragging BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt
                                through the elements in the collec-
                                tion.  Browse select highlights
                                each element as it is traversed,
                                and gives the application an oppor-
                                tunity to provide information about
                                each element as it is highlighted.
                                Releasing BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt on an element
                                selects it and deselects the previ-
                                ously selected element.  Browse
                                selection is described in Section
                                3.1.2

                                elements of a collection.  Clicking
                                BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt on an unselected element
                                adds that element to the current
                                selection.  Clicking BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt on a
                                selected element removes that ele-
                                ment from the current selection.
                                Multiple selection is described in
                                Section 3.1.3

                                of elements in a collection.
                                Clicking BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt on an element
                                selects the single element, and
                                deselects any previous selection.
                                BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt DDDDrrrraaaagggg over a range of ele-

                                within the range, and deselects any















                                previous selection.  Range selec-
                                tion is described in Section 3.1.4

                                multiple discontiguous ranges of
                                elements in a collection.  Clicking
                                or dragging BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt operates just
                                the same as for range selection.
                                Discontiguous selection also allows
                                BBBBTTTToooogggggggglllleeee to be used to add new
                                selection ranges to or remove
                                selection ranges from the selec-
                                tion.  Discontiguous selection is
                                described in Section 3.1.5.

       models.
