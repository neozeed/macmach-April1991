       A mnemonic is a single character that can be associated with
       any component that contains a text label.  The label must
       contain the character, and the character must be underlined
       within the label.  The mnemonic should be the first charac-
       ter of the label.  If a label does not naturally contain the
       character of the mnemonic, the mnemonic must be placed in
       parentheses following the label.  Labels can also be sequen-
       tially numbered, and the number can serve as the mnemonic.
       Labels that are duplicated within an application should be
       given the same mnemonic.  Mnemonics must be case insensitive
       for activation.  Either an uppercase or lowercase letter can
       be underlined in the label.

       When the location cursor is on a component within the same
       field as a component with a mnemonic, a Menu, or a MenuBar,
       typing the mnemonic character must move the location cursor
       to the component and activate it.  If a mnemonic is used for
       an OptionButton or for a CascadeButton in a MenuBar, or
       optionally for a PushButton that is not in a basic group,
       typing MMMMAAAAlllltttt and the mnemonic anywhere in the window or its
       Menus must move the cursor to the component with that
       mnemonic and must activate it.

       Collections can also support mnemonics associated with its
       elements.  Typing a mnemonic while the collection has the
       keyboard focus must be equivalent to moving the location
       cursor to the element and typing KKKKSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt.
