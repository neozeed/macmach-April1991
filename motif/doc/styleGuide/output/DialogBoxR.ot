       A DialogBox should be used to group components in a window
       secondary to the main tasks of the application.  Although a
       DialogBox may contain any components, a simple DialogBox is
       composed of a Label and PushButtons for supplying a response
       to the DialogBox.  The OSF/Motif toolkit provides a number
       of ready-designed DialogBoxes for common uses: CommandDia-
       log, FileSelectionDialog, MessageDialog, PromptDialog, and
       SelectionDialog.  There are also a number of different types
       of MessageDialogs:  ErrorDialog, InformationDialog, Ques-
       tionDialog, WorkingDialog, and WarningDialog.  The illustra-
       tion on this reference page shows a typical DialogBox.

       DialogBox PushButtons should use the following common labels
       and actions.  The actions are in the approximate sequence in
       which they should appear in DialogBoxes.

       YYYYeeeessss    Must indicate an affirmative response to a question
              posed in the DialogBox, and then close the window.
              While YYYYeeeessss is not an active-voice label, it implies a
              positive response to a question in a QQQQuuuueeeessssttttiiiioooonnnnDDDDiiiiaaaalllloooogggg.
              Only use YYYYeeeessss if it is a clear answer to the question.

       NNNNoooo     Must indicate a negative response to a question posed
              in the DialogBox, and then close the window.  While
              NNNNoooo is not an active-voice label, it implies a posi-
              tive response to a question in a QQQQuuuueeeessssttttiiiioooonnnnDDDDiiiiaaaalllloooogggg.
              Only use NNNNoooo if it is a clear answer to the question.

       OOOOKKKK     Must cause the application to apply any changes made
              in the DialogBox and dismiss the DialogBox.  While OOOOKKKK
              is not an active-voice label, its usage is too common
              to change.

       AAAAppppppppllllyyyy  Must apply any changes made to components in the
              DialogBox.

       RRRReeeettttrrrryyyy  Must cause the task in progress to be attempted
              again.  This action is commonly found in message
              boxes that report an error.

       SSSSttttoooopppp   Must end the task in progress at the next possible
              breaking point.  This action is commonly found in
              progress message boxes.

       RRRReeeesssseeeetttt  Must cancel any user changes that have not been
              applied to the application.  It must also reset the
              status of the DialogBox to the state since the last
              time the DialgoBox action was applied or to the ini-
              tial state of the DialogBox.
















       CCCCaaaannnncccceeeellll Must close the DialogBox without performing any
              DialogBox actions not yet applied to the application.
              Pressing KKKKCCCCaaaannnncccceeeellll anywhere in the DialogBox, except
              during a cancelable drag operation, must perform the
              action of this button.

       HHHHeeeellllpppp .... .... .... Must provide any help for the DialogBox.  The
              ellipses should not be used if the help action is not
              provided in a new DialogBox.

       You should arrange PushButton actions in DialogBoxes like
       other PushButtons, according to order and frequency of use.
       The common action PushButtons should be ordered as presented
       in the previous section.  Positive responses to the Dialog-
       Box should be presented first, followed by negative
       responses and canceling responses.  HHHHeeeellllpppp should always be
       the last action on the right.























       A DialogBox must follow the navigation model described in
       Chapter 2.  For more information, see the reference pages
       for CommandDialog, ErrorDialog, FileSelectionDialog, Infor-
       mationDialog, MessageDialog, PromptDialog, QuestionDialog,
       SelectionDialog, WarningDialog, and WorkingDialog.
