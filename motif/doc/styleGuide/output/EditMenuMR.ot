       The common Edit Menu contents are described as follows.
       Note that you should only include those functions actually
       supported by your application.  The illustration on this
       reference page shows an Edit Menu.

                        action.  To provide a visual cue to the
                        user, the UUUUnnnnddddoooo selection title should be
                        dynamically modified to indicate what is
                        being undone.  For example, if the most
                        recently executed action were a paste, the
                        action name would be UUUUnnnnddddoooo ppppaaaasssstttteeee.  Your
                        application should be able to undo all of
                        the actions in the EEEEddddiiiitttt Menu. This action
                        must have the mnemonic UUUU.  If this action
                        has an accelerator, it must override the
                        standard undo action for a specific com-
                        ponent, and must be MMMMAAAAlllltttt KKKKBBBBaaaacccckkkkSSSSppppaaaacccceeee.

                        from the client area to the clipboard
                        buffer.  Your application can determine
                        whether the area that was occupied by the
                        removed data is left blank or whether the
                        remaining data is compressed to fill in the
                        space.  Usually, graphics applications
                        leave the space blank while text applica-
                        tions compress the remaining text to fill
                        in the space.  This action must have the
                        mnemonic TTTT.  If this action has an
                        accelerator, it must override the standard
                        cut action for a specific component, and
                        both MMMMSSSShhhhiiiifffftttt KKKKDDDDeeeelllleeeetttteeee and KKKKPPPPrrrriiiimmmmaaaarrrryyyyCCCCuuuutttt should

                        the clipboard buffer without removing the
                        original data from the client area.  This
                        action must have the mnemonic CCCC.  If this
                        action has an accelerator, it must override
                        the standard copy action for a specific
                        component, and both MMMMCCCCttttrrrrllll KKKKIIIInnnnsssseeeerrrrtttt and KKKKPPPPrrrriiii----

                        buffer into a client area. When there is
                        one main editing area, the application can
                        force the paste to occur in that area.
                        When an accelerator is used and the focus
                        is in an editable component the paste















                        should go to that editable component.  When
                        the focus policy is explicit, and when
                        there are multiple possible destinations
                        for the paste, the paste should go to the
                        last editable component with the input
                        focus.  When the focus policy is implicit,
                        and when there are multiple possible desti-
                        nations for the paste, the paste should go
                        to the component with the destination cur-
                        sor, as described in Section 3.2.3.

                        Your application can determine whether the
                        pasted data is reformatted to fit in the
                        client area and whether existing data moves
                        to create room for the pasted data.  Text
                        applications usually reformat the pasted
                        text to fit into the margins of the text
                        field, and they will move the existing text
                        to make room for the new text.  Graphics
                        applications usually do neither.  This
                        action must have the mnemonic PPPP.  If this
                        action has an accelerator, it must override
                        the standard paste action for a specific
                        component, and both MMMMSSSShhhhiiiifffftttt KKKKIIIInnnnsssseeeerrrrtttt and

       CCCClllle____eeeaaaarrrr            Must remove a selected portion of data from
                        the client area without copying it to a
                        clipboard buffer.  The remaining data is
                        not compressed to fill the space that was
                        occupied by the cleared data.  This action
                        must have the mnemonic EEEE.

       D____DDDeeeelllleeeetttteeee           Must remove a selected portion of data from
                        the client area without copying it to a
                        clipboard buffer. The remaining data is
                        compressed to fill the space that was occu-
                        pied by the deleted data.  This action must
                        have the mnemonic DDDD.
