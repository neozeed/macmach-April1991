       A MainWindow should be used to organize the contents of a
       primary window.  A MainWindow must frame the client area and
       can optionally include ScrollBars, a MenuBar, a command
       area, and a message area.























       A MainWindow must follow the navigation model described in
       Chapter 2.  For more information about the components of the
       MainWindow, see the reference pages for MenuBar, ScrollBar,
       and Text.
