       A window icon is a minimized representation of a window or
       window family that can help organize windows and tasks in
       the display.  The window manager must iconify all windows of
       a window family together.  The application running inside of
       a window must continue running even when the application is
       iconified.

       An icon is made up of an image, a border, and a label.  The
       illustration on this reference page shows a typical Motif
       icon.

       The image must be surrounded by a border that indicates when
       the icon has the keyboard focus.  The image area can contain
       text or a bitmap.  The label must be located just below the
       image and its border.  The label can also indicate when the
       icon has the keyboard focus.  The label should contain the
       same text as the title bar of the corresponding primary win-
       dow, or an abbreviated form of it.  When the icon does not
       have the keyboard focus, the width of the label must be the
       same as the width of the image area and its border.  The
       text must be centered in the label unless it is too large to
       fit in the label, in which case the text should be left jus-
       tified in the label and any extra text truncated.  When the
       icon has the keyboard focus, the width of the label can
       expand to display the entire text. The expanded label must
       be centered on the icon unless it would push off the screen,
       in which case the label should be as close to center as is
       possible while keeping the entire label visible.
