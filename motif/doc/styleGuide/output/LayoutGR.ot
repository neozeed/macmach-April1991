       Layout groups are used for organizing components into groups
       as described in the following text.

                        Sashes are used to set the boundary between
                        two components.  The separated components
                        are called Panes and can contain any com-
                        ponents.
       Layout groups must follow the navigation model as described
       in Chapter 2.  For more information, see the reference pages
       for each layout group.
