       The common Help Menu contents are described as follows.
       Note that you should only include those functions actually
       supported by your application.  The illustration on this
       reference page shows a Help Menu.

                 the shape of the pointer to the question pointer
                 described in Section 2.2.2.  When the user moves
                 the pointer to the component help is wanted on and
                 presses BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt, any available context-sensitive
                 help for the component must be presented, and the
                 pointer reverts from the question pointer.  This
                 action must have the mnemonic CCCC.
