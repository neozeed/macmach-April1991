       The keyboard focus model is defined by a focus policies.  A
       focus policy is a specific mechanism for moving the focus
       among windows and components.  The implicit and explicit
       focus policies must be supported.

       In the implicit focus policy, also called the pointer,
       real-estate driven, or point-to-type policy, the keyboard
       focus moves to the window or component into which a user
       moves the mouse pointer.  No explicit action is performed to
       set the keyboard focus in the implicit focus model.  Key-
       board events are sent to the window or component that the
       mouse pointer is in, more specifically to the component that
       the mouse pointer is in.  In implicit mode, the keyboard
       focus tracks the mouse pointer.  Because of this, there is
       no way to move the keyboard focus from the keyboard using
       implicit mode.  In this focus policy, the location cursor
       for keyboard events does not need to be shown; however, the
       application can show it.

       The mouse pointer always behaves as if the focus policy is
       implicit.  That is, mouse events always go to the window and
       the component that the mouse pointer is in.

       The explicit focus policy requires the user to explicitly
       select which window or component receives the keyboard
       focus.  Mouse events are sent to the component that the
       pointer is over, so the mouse pointer must always behave as
       if the focus policy is implicit, even when the focus policy
       is explicit.  In explicit focus mode, a user moves the key-
       board focus to a window or component by pressing BBBBSSSSeeeelllleeeecccctttt
       while the mouse pointer is over a window or component.  Sim-
       ply moving the mouse pointer over a window or component does
       not give the window or component the keyboard focus.  In
       this focus policy, the location of keyboard focus must be
       shown by a location cursor.

       In explicit mode, keyboard focus moves explicitly among the
       components in a window as well as among the windows.  Moving
       the keyboard focus among components in a window is called
       window navigation.  Keyboard events go to the component in
       the window with the keyboard focus.  See Chapter 2 for more
       information about the focus model.
