The OSF/Motif Documentation

       The Motif documentation set is made up of the following
       documents:

          * AES User Environment Volume

          * OSF/Motif Programmer's Reference

          * OSF/Motif Programmer's Guide

          * OSF/Motif Release Notes

          * OSF/Motif Porting Guide

          * OSF/Motif Style Guide

          * OSF/Motif User's Guide

          * OSF/Motif Test Suite User's Guide

       The entire documentation set is contained in one of the
       major subdirectories (./doc) of the OSF/Motif 1.1 tree.

Structure of the Documentation Directory Tree

       The ./doc directory contains the following files and direc-
       tories.

       README          This file contains a description of the con-
                       tents of the ./doc directory.

       aes             This directory contains the source and out-
                       put files for the AES User Environment
                       Volume.

       build.docs      This file is the script that we used to make
                       the index and table of contents files, and
                       to create the PostScript and output files
                       for each manual.  This script can also be
                       used to lengthen filenames for machines with
                       longname support, and to install manpages
                       onto your system.

       man             This directory contains the source and out-
                       put files for the OSF/Motif Programmer's
                       Reference.

       portingGuide    This directory contains information about
                       porting applications from OSF/Motif.

       programGuide    This directory contains the source and out-
                       put files for the OSF/Motif Programmer's
                       Guide.

       releaseNotes    This directory contains the source and out-
                       put files for these release notes.

       styleGuide      This directory contains the source and out-
                       put files for the OSF/Motif Style Guide.

       testGuide       This directory contains the source and out-
                       put files for the OSF/Motif Test Suite
                       User's Guide.

       tools           This directory contains files used by the
                       build.docs script.  In addition, the tools
                       directory contains a script to convert
                       PostScript figure files to a format suitable
                       for individual printing.  See the section
                       ``Printing PostScript Figures'' below for
                       more information.

       usersGuide      This directory contains the source and out-
                       put files for the OSF/Motif User's Guide.

       Each manual directory is broken into three subdirectories:

       output          These directories contain ASCII versions of
                       the documentation.  These files are suitable
                       for sending to any printer with either the
                       lp or the lpr command.

       postscript      These directories contain PostScript ver-
                       sions of the documentation.  These files are
                       suitable for sending to any PostScript com-
                       patible printer with either the lp or the
                       lpr command.

       source          These directories contain source files for
                       the documentation.  These files are marked
                       up using troff primitives in conjunction
                       with either the man or mm macro package.

       Some source directories may contain a subdirectory called
       graphics.  This directory contains figures for the document
       in PostScript format.  These figures have been included in
       the PostScript output for the manuals in this release.  In
       order to print any of the PostScript figure files individu-
       ally, you need to run a script to convert the format.  See
       the section ``Printing PostScript Figures'' below for more
       information.

       We have included a paper copy of all the PostScript figures
       for people lacking a PostScript printer.

The man/pointer Directory

       Besides source, output and postscript, the man directory
       contains a subdirectory called pointer.  This directory con-
       tains pointer files needed on machines without longname sup-
       port. The pointer files exist to help users resolve name
       conflicts when two manpage names truncate to the same name.

       These pointer files are installed in your manpage directory
       so that when you enter man with an ambiguous file name you
       get information from the pointer file directing you to an
       unambiguous name.  The pointer files are not needed on
       machines with longname support.

build.docs

       The build.docs script was used to create tables of contents,
       indexes, output files, and PostScript files for this
       release.  The script can also be used to install the man-
       pages and convert files for longname support.  The tools
       directory contains scripts and macro files used by the
       build.docs script.  We provide these files as a reference to
       our documentation build procedure.

       The build.docs script is designed to be easy to modify.  It
       is a simple shell script.  You may want to use it in pro-
       cessing the Motif document set.  Please familiarize yourself
       with the script before using it.  It is not fully debugged,
       and may not work correctly under all circumstances.

Change Bars in Documents

       The OSF/Motif Programmer's Guide, OSF/Motif Programmer's
       Reference, and OSF AES/UE have been built with change bars
       in the margins of lines that have changed since Motif 1.0.
       To remove the change bars, you must rebuild the documents
       after removing from the sources all lines that begin with
       .mc.

Including PostScript Figures

       Three of the documents provided with OSF/Motif 1.1 (the
       Programmer's Guide, Style Guide, and User's Guide) include
       figures in PostScript format.  These PostScript files reside
       in a graphics subdirectory beneath the source text files for
       each book.

       These files are included directly into the PostScript output
       for each manual using the .P!  troff macro.  This macro is
       interpreted by the eroff processor to include PostScript
       files into the troff source.  If you are using Transcript
       style troff you may be able to include the PostScript fig-
       ures directly into the troff source by defining the .P!
       macro in a way similar to the following:

            .de P!
            \\&
            .fl
            \\!%PB
            \\!/showpage{}def
            .fl
            .sy cat \\$1
            \\!PE
            \\!.
            .sp \\$2
            ..

Printing PostScript Figures

       In their current form, the PostScript figure files are only
       suitable for inclusion within the text files.  That is, you
       can print any of the chapters and appendixes that include
       figures and the figures will print in the correct positions
       within the text.  However, you cannot print any of the fig-
       ures individually in their current form.

       In order to print an individual figure, you need to convert
       it to the printable format using the conversion script pro-
       vided in the directory ./doc/tools.  The script printfig
       takes a PostScript figure suitable for inclusion in a manual
       and converts it to a format suitable for printing
       separately.  The output of printfig is sent to the standard
       output and can be piped to a printer command.

       For example, if you want to print the PostScript figure
       list1.ps from from the directory
       ./doc/programGuide/source/graphics, you should enter the
       following command.

            printfig ./doc/programGuide/source/graphics/list1.ps | lp

       (Remember to put the ./doc/tools directory in your path or
       copy the figure conversion scripts to your own tools direc-
       tory.)

       Be aware that the figure conversion script can be run on a
       single PostScript file or on multiple files.  Thus, both of
       the following command lines are acceptable:

            printfig -P list1.ps

            printfig -P *
