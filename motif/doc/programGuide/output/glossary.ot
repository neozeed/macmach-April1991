                           widget.  The parent controls where the

                           automatically destroyed.

                           For example, a TitleBar and ScrollBar
                           can be registered with a Panel widget,
                           and the Panel widget will position the
                           TitleBar and ScrollBar widgets
                           correctly.  Normally, a manager widget
                           has no knowledge about its children.

                           be a certain size, it can specify the
