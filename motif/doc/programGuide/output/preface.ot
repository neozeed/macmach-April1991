                 UIL, including names, keywords, literals, func-
                 tions, supported character sets for string
                 literals, and compile-time value expressions.       |

       _C_h_a_p_t_e_r _1_9 describes the syntax of UIL module components
                 (module header, value, procedure, identifier, and
                 object declarations; arguments, controls, call-
                 backs, and procedures lists) and describes addi-
                 tional features of UIL, including symbolic refer-
                 ences to widget IDs and UIL identifiers.            |

                 Motif application, and describes how to access the
                 compiled interface specification at run time using
                 MRM functions.                                      |

                                                            Preface


       _C_h_a_p_t_e_r _2_3 describes the Widget Meta-Language facility, that  |
                 can be used to add new widgets to the UIL com-      |
                 piler.                                              |

       _A_p_p_e_n_d_i_x _A lists constraint arguments that can be specified   |
                 for children of some widgets.                       |

       _A_p_p_e_n_d_i_x _B lists the UIL built-in tables.  For each object    |
                 in the Motif Toolkit, this appendix lists the       |
                 callback reasons and children supported by the UIL  |
                 compiler.                                           |

       _A_p_p_e_n_d_i_x _C provides an alphabetical listing of the UIL argu-
                 ments, their data type, and their equivalent name
                 in the Motif Toolkit.                               |

       _A_p_p_e_n_d_i_x _D lists diagnostic messages issued by the UIL com-   |
                 piler and provides corrective action.               *

            as they appear.

          +o _I_t_a_l_i_c_i_z_e_d strings represent variables (for example,
            function or macro arguments).
