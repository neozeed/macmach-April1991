       Application programs written for Motif are intended to fol-
       low a particular style of appearance and behavior.  This
       common style is designed to directly benefit you so that
       your interaction with all applications is the same and you
       don't have to learn new techniques before putting a new
       application program to work.

       In this chapter you will use the Motif Resource Editor pro-
       gram (mmmmrrrreeee) to change some of the colors and fonts displayed
       on your screen.  In doing so, you will learn the following
       techniques for using a Motif application:

          +o Using a list box with scroll bars

          +o Using pull-down menus (including some shortcuts)

          +o Entering text into an input box

          +o Using push buttons

          +o Reacting to dialogs

          +o Using check boxes and radio buttons

       The examples in this chapter use mmmmrrrreeee to demonstrate general
       techniques for using a Motif application.


















                                                                2-1

       Before working the examples in this chapter, you must start
       the X Window System and the Motif Window Manager just as you
       did in Chapter 1.

       Next, start the mmmmrrrreeee program.  Point to the terminal window
       and click the select button (to make the window active).
       Then type this command:

       If you have correctly entered the command, a few moments
       later you will see the application's window appear on the
       screen.

       If you have trouble starting mmmmrrrreeee, check to see that you
       entered the command properly.  Remember, if the terminal
       window is not the active window, everything you type is
       lost.  If you are still having problems, consult your system
       administrator to be sure everything has been installed prop-
       erly (including the mmmmrrrreeee program).

       The mmmmrrrreeee program has many of the controls that you might use
       in other Motif applications as shown in Figure 2-1.

       As you work through the examples in the rest of this
       chapter, you will learn how to use each of these controls.
       After completing this chapter, you should be able to immedi-
       ately use another Motif application quickly and easily.




























                                                                2-3

       The list box near the center of the mmmmrrrreeee window contains all
       the resources specified in your ....XXXXddddeeeeffffaaaauuuullllttttssss file.  (The mmmmrrrreeee
       program may be used to work with other resource files; ....XXXXddddeeee----
       ffffaaaauuuullllttttssss was loaded by default because you didn't specify a
       file.)

       Whenever the list of resources is larger than the list box,
       mmmmrrrreeee displays scroll bars along the right and bottom edges of
       the box.  A scroll bar is a control that allows you to con-
       trol what portion of a larger object is displayed within the
       box.

       Scroll bars have an arrow at each end and a rectangular
       slider in the middle.  The slider represents the current
       relative position in the list.  There are two ways to move a
       slider:

          +o Using the arrow buttons

          +o Dragging the slider

       Point to the down arrow (|v) in the vertical scroll bar.
       Press and hold the select button until the list stops
       scrolling--it may take a moment to get to the end of the
       list--then release the button.

       Now, point to the slider (which should now be at the bottom
       of the scroll bar), press and hold the select button to grab
       the slider as shown in Figure 2-3. While still holding the
       button, move the pointer up and down and watch the list
       scroll to keep up with your movements.

       On your own, play with the scroll bar controls until you
       feel comfortable with moving the list up and down.  If the
       list has any long lines, mmmmrrrreeee displays a horizontal scroll
       bar for scrolling side-to-side.  Try that one too.

       When a list item is selected, it is highlighted (displayed
       in inverse video) and shows up in the Selection box just
       below the list.  There are two ways to select an item in the
       list:

          +o Point to the item you want to select and click the
            select button.

          +o Or, use the <|^> and <|v> keys to move the highlight to
            the item you want.

       In the next section, you will use the second method to
       select a particular resource.

















                                                                2-5

       A push button is a control that causes an immediate action.
       To press a push button, point to it and then click the
       select button.

       When you first start mmmmrrrreeee, the list box contains all of the

       left of the list box allow you to quickly redisplay the list
       of resources showing only a particular type of resource.

       To display only the resources associated with color, click
       the push button that looks like a painter's palette.  See
       Figure 2-4.

       color resources.  (The other resources have not been
       deleted, mmmmrrrreeee is simply not showing them.)

       Use the <|^> and <|v> keys on your keyboard to move up and

       The frame around the Edit push button means that pressing
       <Return> is equivalent to clicking Edit. Often, the most
       frequently used push button has a frame like this, indicat-
       ing that it is the default selection.

       Press <Return> now to edit the color resource that you
       selected above (xxxxtttteeeerrrrmmmm****bbbbaaaacccckkkkggggrrrroooouuuunnnndddd).  The mmmmrrrreeee program displays
       a new window specifically for editing a color resource.

       will select a new color for this resource.

       Double-clicking on an item in a list is even faster than
       using <Return> or clicking Edit.  Remember, in order to
       double-click, first point to the item, then rapidly press
       and release the select button twice.































                                                                2-7

       So far, most of your interaction with the mmmmrrrreeee program has
       been with the mouse.  In this section, you will use your
       keyboard to enter some text (a color name) into an input
       field.

       Since some application may display more than one input field
       at a time, you may have to select the field you want to type
       into.  To select the input field, point to it and then click
       the select button.

       For this example, point to the box just above the push but-
       tons in the Color Selection Window and click.  An I-shaped
       cursor begins blinking in the box.  This cursor marks your
       typing position.

       Most Motif applications have a menu bar across the top of
       the window (just below the title bar) as shown in Figure 2-
       6.  Each word in the menu bar represents a pull-down menu,
       which is displayed by pulling down on the menu bar with the
       mouse.

       There are two ways to choose a function from a pull-down
       menu using the mouse:

          +o _D_r_a_g _m_e_t_h_o_d: Point to the menu you want to display,
            press and hold the select button, drag the pointer to
            highlight the desired function, and then release the
            button.

          +o _C_l_i_c_k _m_e_t_h_o_d: Point to the menu you want to display,
            click the select button once to display the menu, point
            to the desired function, and then click again.

       If you decide you don't want to execute a function after the
       menu is displayed, point away from the menu (so that no
       function is highlighted), and then release or click the but-
       ton.

       The menu bar is the primary way to access an application's
       functions.  Therefore, browsing through the menus and their
       functions often serves as an excellent overview of a
       program's features.

       The File menu typically contains functions for opening,
       closing, deleting, and printing files as shown in Figure 2-
       7.  To display the File menu, point to FFFFiiiilllleeee in the menu bar,
       and then press and hold the select button.

       that no menu function is highlighted) before releasing the
       button.

       Earlier you used the palette button to cause mmmmrrrreeee to display

       resources.

       Display the View menu by pointing to View in the menu bar
       and holding down the select button.  There are two distin-
       guishing features of the View menu that you may not have
       seen before:

          +o Cascade menus (also called submenus), which are indi-
            cated with an arrow next to the function name.  Cascade
            menus are used to group similar functions together.

          +o Check boxes that represent a group of settings that may
            be set in any combination.  Check boxes, which are fre-
            quently used outside of menus too, are demonstrated in
            the next section.

       While still holding the select button, drag the pointer
       slowly down the menu stopping briefly on each of the selec-
       tions that has an arrow next to it.  Notice that each one
       has a cascade menu that appears as you point to it.  The
       cascade menus in the View menu all contain the same two
       functions:  ascending and descending as shown in Figure 2-9.

       While pointing to the By Resource menu item, carefully move
       the pointer to the right until ascending is also
       highlighted.  Then release the button.  This action, which
       might be read as view by resource in ascending order, causes
       the resources in the list to be sorted and redisplayed in
       ascending (alphabetical) order according to their resource
       names.

       When an application has a finite list of options or set-
       tings, they are often presented as a list of toggle buttons.
       Like a light switch, a toggle button can be on or off.
       There are two ways that a group of toggle buttons may be
       presented:

          +o Check boxes are used for a group of settings that can
            be set in any combination.  Check boxes are usually
            displayed as small square buttons.

          +o Radio buttons are used to group related settings that
            allow only one selection at a time.  Radio buttons are
            usually displayed as small diamond-shaped buttons.

       The mmmmrrrreeee program's View By Resource menu contains a set of
       check boxes; one for each type of resource.  When you first
       start mmmmrrrreeee all the boxes are selected (on), so that all
       resources are displayed.

       The three push buttons along the left edge of the mmmmrrrreeee window
       are provided as shortcuts that unselect all but one type of
       resource (colors, fonts, and true/false types, respec-
       tively).  Since the resource button you pressed most
       recently was the palette button, mmmmrrrreeee is currently displaying
       only color resources.  To also display the font and file
       resources, follow these two steps:

       The mmmmrrrreeee program uses radio buttons to let you specify font
       characteristics.  To see how they work, create a new entry
       for your xxxxtttteeeerrrrmmmm font and open the Font Selection window by
       typing this into the Selection box of the mmmmrrrreeee main window:

       At the top of the Font Selection window, there are four sets
       of radio buttons as shown in Figure 2-10.  Initially, none
       of the buttons is selected. Click one button under each of
       the four categories.  Now go through and click a different
       button in each category.  Notice that only one button at a
       time can be selected in each group.

       find a font that you like, select it (by clicking its name
       in the list) and then click OK.  If your system does not
       support this method of specifying fonts, you may have to
       type a font name into the Selection window (just above the
       push buttons).  If you are really stuck, the font named
       ffffiiiixxxxeeeedddd is available on most systems.

       Earlier in this chapter you learned how to choose menu func-
       tions using the mouse.  Two additional features allow you to
       quickly execute a function in a menu without using the
       mouse.

          +o An accelerator key is a key on your keyboard that the
            application has assigned to directly execute a function
            in a menu.  Accelerators are listed in the menu next to
            the function names.

          +o A mnemonic provides a similar capability by allowing
            you to select from a menu by typing significant letters
            within the menu.  Mnemonics are indicated as underlined
            characters in the menu.

       The important difference is that accelerator keys allow you
       to immediately execute a function without displaying the
       menu.  Mnemonics, on the other hand, are simply a way to
       display menus and choose functions without using the mouse.

       Notice that the Help menu has an accelerator listed in the
       menu bar.  At any time while you are using mmmmrrrreeee, you can get
       help by pressing <F1>.  Try it.

       When you are done with the Help information, click OK in the
       Help window.

       To use a mnemonic to display a menu, hold down the <Alt> key
       and then press the letter that is underlined in the menu's
       name.

       Try this:  Display the Help menu by typing <Alt> <H>
       (because the H is underlined).

       Once a menu is displayed, you can use its mnemonic to exe-
       cute a function by typing the letter that is underlined in
       the function's name.

       If the Help menu is still displayed, press <C> to display
       helpful information about colors.

       After displaying a menu by clicking the mouse or using a
       mnemonic, you can use the cursor keys (<<->, <->>, <|^>, and
       <|v>) to move the highlight.

       When the function you want to execute is highlighted, press
       <Return>.  To cancel the menu without choosing a function,
       press <ESC>.

       Try this:  Display the Help menu again by pressing <Alt>
       <H>.  Now use the <|^> and <|v> keys to move the highlight.
       When the Fonts selection is highlighted, press <Return>.
       Just as before, when you are done reading the Help informa-
       tion, click OK.

       As you've seen, there are two general ways to display a
       pull-down menu:

          +o Using the mouse, point to the menu name in the menu bar
            and then ...

               - Click the select button

               - Or, press and hold the select button

          +o Using the menu's mnemonic (press <Alt> plus the under-
            lined character).  For example, press <Alt> <F> to
            display the File menu.

       2.11.2  CCCChhhhoooooooossssiiiinnnngggg aaaa MMMMeeeennnnuuuu FFFFuuuunnnnccccttttiiiioooonnnn

       Once a menu is displayed, you can choose a function like
       this:

          +o If you are still holding the mouse button, drag the
            pointer down the menu until the desired function is
            highlighted, then release the button.

          +o If you clicked the select button or used the menu's
            mnemonic, you can choose a function using any of these
            techniques:

               - Point to the desired function and click the select
                 button

               - Type the function's mnemonic (underlined charac-
                 ter)

               - Use the cursor keys (<|^>, <|v>, <<->, and <->>) to
                 move the highlight to the desired function, and
                 then press <Return>

       You can also use accelerators to execute menu functions
       without displaying the menu.  For example, the Cut function
       in the Edit menu can be executed by typing <Shift> <Del>.
