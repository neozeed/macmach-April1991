       accelerator         A key or sequence of keys (typically a
                           modifier key and some other key) that
                           provides a shortcut, immediately access-
                           ing a program function.

       accelerator key     A key on your keyboard that the applica-
                           tion has assigned to directly execute a
                           function in a menu.  Accelerators are
                           listed in the menu next to the function
                           names.

       active window       The terminal window in which what you
                           type appears.  If there is no active
                           window, what you type is lost.  Only one
                           terminal window can be active at a time.

       background process  A process that doesn't require the total
                           attention of the computer for operation.
                           Background processing enables the
                           operating system to execute more than
                           one program or command at a time.  As a
                           general rule, all clients should run as
                           background processes.

       cascade menus       A submenu or menu-within-a-menu, that
                           appears when you highlight a menu func-
                           tion that has an arrow next to its name.
                           Cascade menus are used to group similar
                           functions together.

       check boxes         A group of toggle buttons that can be
                           set in any combination.  Check boxes may
                           appear in a menu or in a program's win-
                           dow.  Check boxes are usually displayed
                           as small square buttons.

       click               To press and release a mouse button.
                           The term comes from the fact that press-
                           ing and releasing the buttons of most
                           mice makes a clicking sound.

       client              A program written specifically for X.
                           Clients make their own windows and know
                           how to resize and minimize themselves.

       command-line prompt Shows that the computer is ready to
                           accept your commands.  Each terminal
                           emulation window has a command-line
                           prompt that acts just like the command-
                           line prompt you see on the screen
                           immediately after login (before starting
                           X).  Usually the command-line prompt is
                           either a $$$$ (for Bourne and Korn shells)
                           or a %%%% (for C shells).  You can find the
                           command-line prompt by pressing <Return>
                           several times.  Every time you press
                           <Return>, the operating system prints
                           the prompt.

       configuration files Text files containing set-up and confi-
                           guration information for X clients. A
                           configuration file may be used for one
                           particular client or for many clients.

       double-click        To press and release a mouse button
                           twice in rapid succession.

       drag                To press and hold down a mouse button
                           while moving the mouse on the desktop
                           (and the pointer on the screen).  Typi-
                           cally, dragging is used with menu
                           selecting, and window moving and resiz-
                           ing.

       fonts               A font is a style of printed text char-
                           acters.  Times Roman is the font used
                           for most newspaper text; Helvetica is
                           the font used for newspaper headlines.

       home directory      The directory in which you are placed
                           after you log in.  Typically, this is
                           ////uuuusssseeeerrrrssss////_u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e, where _u_s_e_r_n_a_m_e is your
                           login name.  The home directory is where
                           you keep all your files.  Type ccccdddd
                           <Return> to change to your home direc-
                           tory.  Type eeeecccchhhhoooo $$$$HHHHOOOOMMMMEEEE <Return> to view
                           the path and name of your home direc-
                           tory.

       icon                A small, graphic representation of an
                           object on the root window (typically a
                           terminal window).  Objects can be

                           minimized (turned into icons) to clear a
                           cluttered workspace and restored
                           (returned to their original appearance)
                           as needed.  Processes executing in an
                           object continue to execute when the
                           object is minimized.

       mnemonic            An underlined character in a menu.
                           Mnemonics allow you to display menus and
                           choose functions by typing letters on
                           your keyboard.

       non-client          A program that is written to run on a
                           terminal and so must be fooled by a ter-
                           minal emulation window into running in
                           the window environment.

       pointer             Sometimes called the mouse cursor, the
                           pointer shows the location of the mouse.
                           The pointer's shape depends on its loca-
                           tion.  In the root window, the pointer
                           is an x.  On a window frame, the pointer
                           is an arrowhead.  Inside the frame, the
                           pointer can be an arrowhead (as when it
                           is inside a clock or load histogram
                           frame) or an I-beam (as when it is
                           inside a terminal window).

       pull-down menu      A menu accessed by pointing to the menu
                           bar and pulling down with the mouse.
                           Pull-down menus are generally organized
                           by the types of functions they contain.

       push button         A control that causes an immediate
                           action.  To press a push button on the
                           screen, point to it then click the
                           select button.

       radio buttons       A group of toggle buttons that allows
                           you to select only one of the selections
                           at a time.  Radio buttons may appear in
                           a menu or in a program's window.  Radio
                           buttons are usually displayed as small
                           diamond-shaped buttons.

       restore             To change an icon back into its original
                           window.

       root menu           The menu associated with the root win-
                           dow.  The root menu enables you to con-
                           trol the behavior of your environment.

       root window         The root window is what the screen (the
                           flat viewing surface of the terminal)
                           becomes when you start X.  To a certain
                           extent, you can think of the root as the
                           screen.  The root window is the backdrop
                           of your X environment.  Although you can
                           hide the root window under terminal win-
                           dows or other graphic objects, you can
                           never position anything behind the root
                           window.  All windows and graphic objects
                           appear stacked on the root window.

       scroll bars         A control that allows you to control
                           what portion of a larger object is
                           displayed within a window.  The slider
                           represents the relative position in the
                           list.  The size of the slider represents
                           the relative portion of the list that is
                           currently visible.

       select button       The mouse button used for most opera-
                           tions.  By default the select button is
                           the left mouse button.

       terminal type       The type of terminal attached to your
                           computer.  The operating system uses the
                           terminal type to set the TTTTEEEERRRRMMMM environ-
                           ment variable so that it can communicate
                           with the terminal correctly.  The termi-
                           nal type is usually set at login, but
                           can be set afterward.

       terminal window     A terminal window is a window that emu-
                           lates a complete display terminal.  Ter-
                           minal windows are typically used to fool
                           non-client programs into believing they
                           are running in their favorite terminal-
                           -not a difficult task in most cases.
                           When not running programs or executing
                           operating system commands, terminal win-
                           dows display the command-line prompt.
                           Two terminal windows are supplied with
                           X, hhhhpppptttteeeerrrrmmmm, which emulates HP terminals,
                           and xxxxtttteeeerrrrmmmm, which emulates DEC and Tek-
                           tronix terminals.

       title bar           The title bar is the rectangular area
                           between the top of the window and the
                           window frame.  The title bar contains
                           the title of the window object, usually
                           ``Terminal Emulator'' for xxxxtttteeeerrrrmmmm windows,

       toggle buttons      Small buttons that can be switched on
                           and off.  To switch a toggle button,
                           point to it and click the select button.

       window manager      The window manager controls the size,
                           placement, and operation of windows on
                           the root window.  MWM includes the func-
                           tional window frames that surround each
                           window object as well as a menu for the
                           root window.  MWM is a client program of
                           the X Window System.

       window menu         The menu that appears when you press the
                           window menu button on a window frame.
                           Every window has a system menu that
                           enables you to control the size, shape,
                           and position of the window.

       xclock              An X client program that displays the
