       Welcome to OSF/MotifTM, a user environment based on the X
       Window System designed to make your interaction with your
       computer easier and more productive.

       This guide is intended to teach you the fundamentals of
       working with MotifTM.  More specifically, you will learn how
       to:

          +o Create and manipulate windows on your screen

          +o Use application programs written for the Motif environ-
            ment

          +o Personalize your Motif environment to suit your own
            needs and tastes

       Before you begin working through the examples, take note
       that this guide assumes the following:

          +o You have a valid login on your computer and know the
            password.

          +o The required software has been properly installed.
            This includes the X Window System, OSF/Motif, and the
            Motif Resource Editor program (mmmmrrrreeee).

          +o Your system administrator has explained how to log into
            your  computer and start the X Window System and the
            Motif Window Manager.

          +o You are familiar enough with your computer to execute
            simple commands and use a text editor.

          +o You are using the default configurations for Motif.  If
            you (or your system administrator) have customized your
            Motif environment, the appearance and behavior of your
            environment may not match the examples that follow.

          +o You have a system that uses a mouse or some other
            pointing device.

       To get the most out of this guide, you should work your way
       sequentially through the numbered chapters:

          +o Chapter 1, _I_n_t_r_o_d_u_c_i_n_g _M_o_t_i_f, introduces you to the
            mouse and teaches you simple techniques for manipulat-
            ing windows on your display.

          +o Chapter 2, _U_s_i_n_g _a _M_o_t_i_f _A_p_p_l_i_c_a_t_i_o_n, guides you
            through a simple application and teaches you how to use
            common program controls such as menus, push buttons,
            and scroll bars.

          +o Chapter 3, _C_u_s_t_o_m_i_z_i_n_g _Y_o_u_r _M_o_t_i_f _E_n_v_i_r_o_n_m_e_n_t, leads
            you through some simple customizations to your environ-
            ment.

       You should read each chapter in a single sitting--you'll
       probably spend between 25 and 45 minutes per chapter.  Most
       importantly, as you read the text and look at the figures,
       work the examples on your own computer.

       After completing Chapter 3, you will be prepared to start
       using Motif in your everyday work.  It's also likely that
       you will want to further customize your own environment.  To
       help you get started, this guide includes the following
       appendixes:

          +o Appendix A, Specifying Colors, provides a list of color
            names and briefly describes how to specify custom
            colors.

          +o Appendix B, A List of Font Names, lists the font names
            that are available for you to choose from.

          +o Appendix C, Clients That Help You Manage Windows
            describes two utility programs for the X Window System.

       Additional material about Motif is listed at the end of this
       preface. You do not need to read and understand this addi-
       tional information to use Motif effectively.

       If the mouse buttons or other functions do not seem to be
       operating as described in this guide, you can reset the
       entire environment to use the default behavior.  To do this,
       press these four keys simultaneously:

       <<<<AAAAlllltttt>>>> <<<<CCCCTTTTRRRRLLLL>>>> <<<<SSSShhhhiiiifffftttt>>>> <<<<!!!!>>>>

       A message box may appear at the center of the screen to con-
       firm that you want to reset the behavior.  Point to the OOOOKKKK
       button and click the left mouse button--the select button.

       To return to the previous behavior, press the reset keys
       again.
