OSF's engineering policy requires rigorous regression testing of all MOTIF
code. Fixes for problems discovered after code freeze cannot be integrated
into the source without restarting the regression tests. The patch
included on this tape fixes an important problem with secondary selection
in the Text widget. Because of our policy, integrating this change would
have resulted in an unacceptable delay in the release of Motif 1.1.

As an alternative, we are providing this patch, which has passed
preliminary testing. OSF will send a confirming message to motif-talk upon
completion of the regression tests.

To apply the patch, you may use the patch program supplied
in the ./util/patch directory (copied unmodified from MIT X11
R4 distribution) and follow the directions in the release notes.
