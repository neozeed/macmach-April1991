These are the MacMach sources.  See /usr/src/.README for checksums.

All system building must be done with a MacMach system, not an Andrew system.

It is best to copy the entire source tree to the local disk as /usr/src.

A seperate object directory, /usr/obj, will be created automatically.

A 600MB disk is suggested for building systems.

See /usr/src/etc/etc.mac2/newconfig/README.INSTALL for more information.

You will want to customize the following:

    /usr/src/VERSION
    /usr/src/etc/etc.mac2/rc.ramdisk
    /usr/src/etc/etc.mac2/macmach.proto

Create an installable system in /usr/os by:

    rm -rf /usr/os
    cd /usr/src
    make

Create /usr/obj/ramdisk_image by:

    [ connect a scratch disk ]

    cd /usr/obj
    make ramdisk
