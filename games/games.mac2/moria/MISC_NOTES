The most recent version of UNIX Moria can be obtained via
anonymous ftp from ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU at present.
In the future, I shall try to keep the sources available on
ucbarpa.Berkeley.EDU and/or ucbvax.Berkeley.EDU.

The two parts of the moria manual should be concatenated together
into a single file (i.e.: cat moria.doc.? >moria.orig.doc).
Work is under way to create an updated troff form of the manual.

The game needs to be installed setuid for the scoreboard to work.
Use the command 'chmod 4511 moria' to do this.
The file Highscores should be mode 644 with the same owner as moria.
The files Moria_hours and Moria_news must be publicly readable with
mode 444.

Restoring touched save files is possible, but not very easy.
The following is a rough outline of the steps necessary:
1) User changes mode of save file so that wizard can read it.
2) Wizard changes umask so that files created will be publicly writable
    i.e. for csh type 'umask 0'
   Also, the directory that this is done in must be publicly writable.
3) Wizard uses 'wizard restore' command to read in touched save file.
4) While still in wizard mode, save the game.
5) User can then read in the new save file, deleting it in the process.
6) Wizard changes umask back to original value, i.e. 'umask 22'.
