The files on this disk are all compressed tar files. This was the easiest way
for me to do it. In each directory is a file that contains the files that
should be in that directory. The easiest way to extract everything is:
(from csh)
	% zcat top_t.Z | tar xvf -
	% foreach i (amiga auxil include mac others src vms)
	? echo unpacking $i
	? cd $i
	? zcat * | tar xvf -
	? cd ..
	? end
	% 
In case you don't have compress/uncompress, I've included a copy of it (uncompressed
of course) on this disk, too. To extract it, just type: "sh <compress.shr".

This is all assuming you've copied the files off of the floppy and onto the
SparcStation. The files were copied onto the disk using the 'mtools' package,
so it should be in MS-DOS format.
