The following changes have been made to this directory since R3:

	o  New DDX interfaces integrated
	o  8-bit specific code added:

		Stipples, text, copyplane, pushpixels

	o  non-8 bit code added:

		0-width lines, 0-width arcs, filled arcs,
		tiles, copyarea
	
	o  New colormap code.  CFB now provides all 6 standard
	   visual types.  Other non-frame buffer displays should
	   use the new color resolving functions.

This directory now provides a real implementation for 8-bit frame buffers,
driving the frame buffer at memory bandwidth for many operations using
a reasonable CPU (R2000, SPARC at least).
