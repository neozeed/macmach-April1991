This directory contains a number of simple programs that show how to use
the Athena widgets and the X Toolkit.  These examples have been
organized so that a new programmer can begin with simple examples and
work up to more complex ones.

1) xhw 		- "Xt Hello World" is the simplest example.  It shows
		  how to initialize the toolkit and use the Label widget
		  to display a string.  

2) xlabel 	- Another example using the Label widget.  Introduces
		  the programmer to X Toolkit command line parsing.

3) xcommand 	- This example uses the Command widget to show how
		  callback functions are defined and how to use them to
		  get user data.

4) xcommand2 	- This example performs the same task as xcommand, but
		  uses application defined action routines to retrieve
		  user input instead of callback functions.

5) xlist 	- An example of how to use the List widget.

6) xscroll 	- An example of the values returned by the Scrollbar
		  widget, and how its callback routines are used. 

7) xbuttonbox 	- The Box widget is used to introduce the programmer to
		  a widget hierarchy. 

8) xboxes 	- Nested widget hierarchies, and application specific
		  resources are introduced. 

9) xtext 	- An example using the Text widget.  Changing the text
		  string, and getting the value out of the Text widget
		  are explained.  This is the first place that widget
		  data is changed dynamically. 

10) popup 	- Creating a popup widget with a dialog box, and
		  positioning the popup are explained. 

11) xmenu1
    xmenu2  	- Two examples of how to use the SimpleMenu widget.

12) xwidgets 	- A complicated example program that uses every widget
		  in the Athena widget set at least once.  Timeouts are
		  also used in this example.
