The specifications for this extension are out for Public Review.  The
objective of Public Review is to determine if the current draft is
acceptable as a Consortium standard.  Public Review can result in
changes to the draft standard.  Public Review of the Input Extension
is scheduled to end April 16, 1990.  The X community is encouraged to
review the draft and submit comments by electronic mail to
	input-ext@expo.lcs.mit.edu
You may send written comments to
	Bob Scheifler
	Laboratory for Computer Science
	545 Technology Square
	Cambridge, MA 02139
Comments sent to other addresses are not guaranteed to be considered.

Commentors should take the review process seriously, and should:
	1. Identify objectionable wording in the document.
	2. Suggest specific alternative wording.
and most importantly:
	3. Provide a rationale for the suggested change.

Commentors should also carefully distinguish between:
	1. Problems that they regard as intolerable and that must be corrected
	   before the document becomes a standard.
	2. Aspects that they don't like but could live with for a few years
	   until a future revision of the standard.
	3. Additional functionality that they can live without in an initial
	   standard but would like to see in a future revision.

A Consortium committee will review the comments and respond to commentors.
