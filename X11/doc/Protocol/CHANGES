Various minor editorial corrections and clarifications have been made.

The Protocol now defines the use of a "group modifier" to obtain up to
two additional keysyms per key.

The interpretation of characters ``?'' (octal value 77) and ``*''
(octal value 52) in OpenFont is not defined by the core protocol,
but is reserved for future definition.

The set of "standard" properties has been replaced by a reference
to the X Logical Font Description Conventions standard.

In QueryTextExtents, characters with all zero metrics are specified
to be ignored.

In FillPoly, contiguous coincident points in the path are not treated
as self-intersection.  Convex means that for every pair of points inside
the polygon, the line segment connecting them does not intersect the path.

VoidSymbol has been added as a new keysym.

The spelling of numerous keysym names has been changed to match the
ISO standards.
