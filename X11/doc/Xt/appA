\fBAppendix A \- Resource File Format\fP
.XE
A resource file contains text representing the default resource values for an
application or set of applications.
.LP
The format of resource files is defined by \fI\*(xL\fP and is reproduced here
for convenience only. 
.LP
The format of a resource specification is:
.TS
l l .
ResourceLine	= Comment | ResourceSpec
Comment	= "!" string | <empty line>
ResourceSpec	= WhiteSpace ResourceName WhiteSpace ":" WhiteSpace value
ResourceName	= [Binding] ComponentName {Binding ComponentName}
Binding	= "." | "*"
WhiteSpace	= {" " | "\\\\t"}
ComponentName	= {"A"-"Z" | "a"-"z" | "0"-"9" | "_" | "-"}
value	= string
string	= {<any character not including "\\\\n">}
.TE
.LP
where {...} means zero or more occurrences of the enclosed elements.
.LP
If the last character on a line is a backslash (\\),
that line is assumed to continue on the next line.
.LP
To include a newline character in a string, use ``\\n''.
To include
arbitrary octets in a string, use the 4-character sequence ``\\nnn''
where nnn is the numeric value of the octet specified as an octal
constant.  For example, a value containing a NULL byte may be stored
by including ``\\000'' in the string.
