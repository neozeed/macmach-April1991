Since the regular documentation is rather detailed, this will be almost equally brief.

What you need to do :
	edit the Imakefile to reflect your system's setup with regard to where
	you will have the xtrek lib directory living, and where the font should
	go.

	remake the makefile (make Makefile)

	make paths.h

	make decl.h

	compile everything

	install the new font. one of the most common mistakes is to have the old
	xtrek font somewhere ahead of the new one on your searchpath, or to simply
	forget to install.  if you start shooting fed ships as your torp character,
	this is the problem.

	install the config files and man page (this is not automatic - sorry)

GO FOR IT!
