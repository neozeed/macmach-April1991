I really hope not ... but ...

Bugs/Darn I wish I had time to :

	Config file documentation could use some sprucing up

	messages are not working very reliably. this needs to be
		tracked down, but is not a major problem to say
		the least.

	some strange alert status problems on the DEC 3100 (ultrix 3.1)
		need to be checked out.

	Imakefile needs to install everything. Unfortunately, CMU doesn't
		use imake, and I am reluctant to shoot in the dark on
		this. If someone could send me a better one ...

	Man pages need to be more useful. Currently, the regular docs are
		real real good, and moving it to *roff format is a waste.
		However, they are functional.

Wish List :

	This is very short becuase we are working on Starfleet (an xtrek killer :-)

		get rid of newwin.c and make the planet and player windows
			dynamicaly sizing like the score window.

		code could *still* use some more uncrufting in places.


Other than this, we really hope it works!!! It has been confirmed running on

	DECstation 3100 under Ultrix 3.1
	VAXstation 2000 under Ultrix 3.1
	IBM RT under IBM ACIS 4.3
	Sun 3/* under SunOS 3.5 and 4.0
	Sun 4/* under SunOS 4.0
