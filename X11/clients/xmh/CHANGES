The following changes have been made to this directory since R3:

     o  Much of xmh, particularly the interface, has been rewritten.
     o  The documentation is accurate and complete.
     o  Supports one level of subfolders, using menus.
        Folders without subfolders will have no menus; folder buttons
        will still function for those.  Only toplevel folders have buttons.
     o  Commands in the main toc & view window are found in menus
        at the top of the window; these correspond to the R3 grouping
        of command buttons (with the exception of Compose Message, which,
        is at the top of the Message menu.  The functionality
        of these commands has not changed.
     o  Buttons are Oval; this is a settable resource from Xaw.
     o  Action procedures are implemented and documented for each command.
     o  Other action procedures support special accelerator translations
	by placing folder and/or sequence names on a stack, for example:
        XmhOpenFolder and XmhOpenSequence will take a parameter as the
	name of a folder or sequence to open.  See the man page.
     o  Keyboard and pointer accelerators are defined and customizable.
	and accelerators are installed in all xmh real estate.
     o  Accelerators are removed in the view while editing in the view.
        This is true of the view in the main window and the separate view 
        window.
     o  Buttons in view and comp windows are can have customized functions,
        because they use action procedures rather than callbacks.
     o  Accelerators are "insensitive" when appropriate.
     o  popups rewritten.
     o  The Create Folder popup accepts Return as equivalent to clicking Okay.
     o  The Create Folder popup sets keyboard focus to the text input field.
     o  The Create Folder popup engages user in dialog if an error occurs.
     o  stderr from mh commands are reported in Notice popups.
     o  Rescanning "popup" is gone; rescanning notice is now in the 
        folder titlebar.
     o  CheckFrequency resource can be used to turn reduce rescanning.
     o  When deleting a folder, xmh will display the toc (Table of Contents)
        of the folder to be deleted.  After the user confirms or 
        cancels the delete, xmh will revert to displaying the previously 
        displayed folder toc, unless, as before, it has been deleted;
        in that case, the InitialFolder	(inbox) is opened in the toc and 
        becomes the current folder.  xmh used to open the (alphabetically)
        first folder in the toc after the current one was deleted.
     o  Generally, any unsaved changes are confirmed before xmh will exit.
     o  Generally, popups which ask for confirmation on deleting some work or
	changes that you made but didn't save will pop up in the *middle* 
        of the window, instead of close to the most recent event.
     o  Window gravity is set on confirm popups.
     o  The settable resource BlockEventsOnBusy can prevent user input and
        show a settable busy cursor while xmh is rescanning.
     o  Sequence buttons are gone; sequences are shown in the Sequence menu.
     o  Options menu, or ReadInReverse resource, allows user to read mail in
        reverse order without the hassle of auto increment in wrong direction.
     o  Text edit caret position cursor invisible in the toc.
     o  Text fields in popups are not editable if they only show a message
	as opposed to taking user input.
     o  PointerColor resource for the regular xmh cursor.
     o  The pull-down command menus were implemented so that users can define
        private translations to use them as pop-up command menus.
     o  Popup command menus have ability to remember previous selection
	see StickyMenu resource.
     o  A customizable, optional command buttonbox can be created in
	the middle of the main toc and view screen.  See CommandButtonCount.
     o  The file clients/xmh/Xmh.sample gives sample customizations.
     o  App defaults specifies resources by class name so user can 
	override more easily with instance name.
     o  Widget hierarchy given in man page.
     o  version file is replaced by settable Banner resource.
     o  new resource PrefixWmAndIconName, so icon names can be folder names.
     o  For reasons of consistency, as long as everybody has to 
        re-write many xmh resource specifications anyway, the following
        changes to R3 extant application resource names and classes
        have been made:

      	Application resource *capitalization* changes, made to the
	*instance* names:

	Old			New
	---			---
	tempdir			tempDir
	mhpath			mhPath
	initialfolder		initialFolder
	initialincfile		initialIncFile
	replyinsertfilter	replyInsertFilter
	draftsfolder		draftsFolder
	sendwidth		sendWidth
	sendbreakwidth		sendBreakWidth
	printcommmand		printCommand
	tocwidth		tocWidth
	skipdeleted		skipDeleted
	skipmoved		skipMoved
	skipcopied		skipCopied
	hideboringheaders	hideBoringHeaders
	tocgeometry		tocGeometry
	viewgeometry		viewGeometry
	compgeometry		compGeometry
	pickgeometry		pickGeometry
	tocpercentage		tocPercentage
	checknewmail		checkNewMail
	makecheckpoints		makeCheckpoints
	mailpath		mailPath
	mailwaitingflag		mailWaitingFlag
	

	Capitalization changes made to app resource *class* names:

	tempDir			TempDir
	makeCheckPoints		MakeCheckpoints

     o  Selecting a drafts folder message to edit using UseAsCompostion 
        no longer overwrites the currently viewed message when the 
        changes are saved.
     o  Some obscure errors now have popup dialog boxes explaining
	what happened, instead of just ringing the bell.  Obscure,
        meaning, some system call failed, can't insert a file...
     o  The default reply insert filter is cat, used to be echo.
     o  WM_DELETE_WINDOW support.
     o  Pick window looks the same, but uses toggle widgets 
	for Pick/Skip and Yes/No; these used to be command widgets.
     o  Double clicking no longer acts as automatic confirmation
        when deleting a folder.
     o  Protection against double clicks on close button when one 
        is enough, and two is too much.
     o  Text options given in app defaults file, not in code,
        whenever acceptable.
     o  EDisk Source removed; xmh uses the ascii source from Xaw,
        which now supports editable file sources.  Toc source rewritten.
     o  Geometry management code deleted; this is done by the
        X Toolkit Intrinsics now.
     o  Warns the user when app-defaults file is not installed.
        This can be turned off by a hidden (undocumented) resource.
     o  mh command dispatch code rewritten.
     o  The PRIMARY selection is asserted in the toc, instead of defaulting.
     o  The Text widget's new Search and Replace popup is prevented
        in pick and popup text fields, and in the Table of Contents.
